**(a) Grounds.**

**(1) By a Plaintiff.** Persons with claims that may expose a plaintiff to double or multiple liability may be joined as defendants and required to interplead. Joinder for interpleader is proper even though:

**(A)** the claims of the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or

**(B)** the plaintiff denies liability in whole or in part to any or all of the claimants.

**(2) By a Defendant.** A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim.

**(b) Relation to Other Rules and Statutes.** This rule supplements — and does not limit — the joinder of parties allowed by Rule 20. The remedy this rule provides is in addition to — and does not supersede or limit — the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1335, 1397, and 2361. An action under those statutes must be conducted under these rules.
