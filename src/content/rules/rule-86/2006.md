## Appended Forms

(93) (See Rule 84) Introductory Statement 1. The following forms are intended for illustration only. They are lim- ited in number. No attempt is made to furnish a manual of forms. Each form assumes the action to be brought in the Southern District of New York. If the district in which an action is brought has divisions, the divi- sion should be indicated in the caption. 2. Except where otherwise indicated each pleading, motion, and other paper should have a caption similar to that of the summons, with the des- ignation of the particular paper substituted for the word ‘‘Summons’’. In the caption of the summons and in the caption of the complaint all parties must be named but in other pleadings and papers, it is sufficient to state the name of the first party on either side, with an appropriate indication of other parties. See Rules 4(b) [now (a)], 7(b)(2), and 10(a). 3. In Form 3 and the forms following, the words, ‘‘Allegation of jurisdic- tion,’’ are used to indicate the appropriate allegation in Form 2. 4. Each pleading, motion, and other paper is to be signed in his individ- ual name by at least one attorney of record (Rule 11). The attorney’s name is to be followed by his address as indicated in Form 3. In forms following Form 3 the signature and address are not indicated. 5. If a party is not represented by an attorney, the signature and address of the party are required in place of those of the attorney. Form 1. Summons United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Civil Action, File Number llll A. B., Plaintiff v. Summons C. D., Defendant To the above-named Defendant: You are hereby summoned and required to serve upon __________________________ , plaintiff’s attorney, whose address is __________________________ , an answer to the complaint which is herewith served upon you, within 20 days after service of this summons upon you, exclusive of the day of service. If you fail to do so, judgment by default will be taken against you for the relief demanded in the complaint. __________________________ , Clerk of Court. [Seal of the U.S. District Court] Dated __________________________ (This summons is issued pursuant to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) (As amended Dec. 29, 1948, eff. Oct. 20, 1949.) Form 1A Form 1A. Notice of Lawsuit and Request for Waiver of Service of Summons TO: __________________________ (A) __________________________ [as __________________________ (B) __________________________ of __________________________ (C) __________________________ ] A lawsuit has been commenced against you (or the entity on whose behalf you are addressed). A copy of the complaint is at- tached to this notice. It has been filed in the United States Dis- trict Court for the __________________________ (D) __________________________ and has been as- signed docket number __________________________ (E) __________________________ . This is not a formal summons or notification from the court, but rather my request that you sign and return the enclosed waiv- er of service in order to save the cost of serving you with a judi- cial summons and an additional copy of the complaint. The cost of service will be avoided if I receive a signed copy of the waiver within __________________________ (F) __________________________ days after the date designated below as the date on which this Notice and Request is sent. I en- close a stamped and addressed envelope (or other means of cost- free return) for your use. An extra copy of the waiver is also at- tached for your records. If you comply with this request and return the signed waiver, it will be filed with the court and no summons will be served on you. The action will then proceed as if you had been served on the date the waiver is filed, except that you will not be obligated to answer the complaint before 60 days from the date designated below as the date on which this notice is sent (or before 90 days from that date if your address is not in any judicial district of the United States). If you do not return the signed waiver within the time indi- cated, I will take appropriate steps to effect formal service in a manner authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and will then, to the extent authorized by those Rules, ask the court to require you (or the party on whose behalf you are addressed) to pay the full costs of such service. In that connection, please read the statement concerning the duty of parties to waive the service of the summons, which is set forth on the reverse side (or at the foot) of the waiver form. I affirm that this request is being sent to you on behalf of the plaintiff, this ll day of llll , ll . __________________________ Signature of Plaintiff’s Attorney or Unrepresented Plaintiff N A—Name of individual defendant (or name of officer or agent of cor- porate defendant) B—Title, or other relationship of individual to corporate defendant C—Name of corporate defendant, if any D—District E—Docket number of action F—Addressee must be given at least 30 days (60 days if located in foreign country) in which to return waiver (As added Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993.) Form 1B Form 1B. Waiver of Service of Summons TO: lll (name of plaintiff’s attorney or unrepresented plain- tiff) lll I acknowledge receipt of your request that I waive service of a summons in the action of llll (caption of action) llll , which is case number llll (docket number) llll in the United States District Court for the llll (district) llll . I have also received a copy of the complaint in the action, two cop- ies of this instrument, and a means by which I can return the signed waiver to you without cost to me. I agree to save the cost of service of a summons and an addi- tional copy of the complaint in this lawsuit by not requiring that I (or the entity on whose behalf I am acting) be served with judi- cial process in the manner provided by Rule 4. I (or the entity on whose behalf I am acting) will retain all de- fenses or objections to the lawsuit or to the jurisdiction or venue of the court except for objections based on a defect in the sum- mons or in the service of the summons. I understand that a judgment may be entered against me (or the party on whose behalf I am acting) if an answer or motion under Rule 12 is not served upon you within 60 days after llll (date request was sent) llll , or within 90 days after that date if the request was sent outside the United States. __________________________ __________________________ Date Signature Printed/typed name: __________________________ [as __________________________ ] [of __________________________ ] To be printed on reverse side of the waiver form or set forth at the foot of the form: D A U C S S Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires certain parties to cooperate in saving unnecessary costs of service of the summons and complaint. A defendant located in the United States who, after being noti- fied of an action and asked by a plaintiff located in the United States to waive service of a summons, fails to do so will be required to bear the cost of such service unless good cause be shown for its failure to sign and re- turn the waiver. It is not good cause for a failure to waive service that a party believes that the complaint is unfounded, or that the action has been brought in an improper place or in a court that lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action or over its person or property. A party who waives service of the summons retains all defenses and objections (except any re- lating to the summons or to the service of the summons), and may later object to the jurisdiction of the court or to the place where the action has been brought. A defendant who waives service must within the time specified on the waiver form serve on the plaintiff’s attorney (or unrepresented plaintiff) a response to the complaint and must also file a signed copy of the re- sponse with the court. If the answer or motion is not served within this time, a default judgment may be taken against that defendant. By waiving service, a defendant is allowed more time to answer than if the summons had been actually served when the request for waiver of service was re- ceived. (As added Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993.) Form 2 Form 2. Allegation of Jurisdiction (a) Jurisdiction founded on diversity of citizenship and amount. Plaintiff is a [citizen of the State of Connecticut] [corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut having its principal place of business in the State of Connecticut] and de- fendant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of New York having its principal place of business in a State other than the State of Connecticut. The matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum specified by 28 U.S.C. § 1332. (b) Jurisdiction founded on the existence of a Federal question. The action arises under [the Constitution of the United States, Article l , Section l ]; [the l Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, Section l ]; [the Act of l , l Stat. l ; U.S.C., Title l , § l ]; [the Treaty of the United States (here describe the treaty)] as hereinafter more fully appears. (c) Jurisdiction founded on the existence of a question arising under particular statutes. The action arises under the Act of l , l Stat. l ; U.S.C., Title l , § l , as hereinafter more fully appears. (d) Jurisdiction founded on the admiralty or maritime character of the claim. This is a case of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, as herein- after more fully appears. [If the pleader wishes to invoke the dis- tinctively maritime procedures referred to in Rule 9(h), add the following or its substantial equivalent: This is an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h).] E N 1. Diversity of Citizenship . U.S.C., Title 28, § 1332 (Diversity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs), as amended by P.L. 85–554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, states in subsection (c) that ‘‘For the purposes of this section and section 1441 of this title [removable actions], a corporation shall be deemed a citizen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal place of business.’’ Thus if the defendant corporation in Form 2(a) had its principal place of business in Connecticut, diversity of citizenship would not exist. An allegation regarding the prin- cipal place of business of each corporate party must be made in addition to an allegation regarding its place of incorporation. 2. Jurisdictional Amount . U.S.C., Title 28, § 1331 (Federal question; amount in controversy; costs) and § 1332 (Diversity of citizenship; amount in con- troversy; costs), as amended by P.L. 85–554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, re- quire that the amount in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of $10,000. The allegation as to the amount in controversy may be omitted in any case where by law no jurisdictional amount is required. See, for example, U.S.C., Title 28, § 1338 (Patents, copyrights, trade-marks, and unfair competition), § 1343 (Civil rights and elective franchise). 3. Pleading Venue . Since improper venue is a matter of defense, it is not necessary for plaintiff to include allegations showing the venue to be prop- er. See 1 Moore’s Federal Practice, par. 0.140 [1.—4] (2d ed. 1959). (As amended Apr. 17, 1961, eff. July 19, 1961; Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec. 1, 1993; Apr. 26, 1999, eff. Dec. 1, 1999.) Form 6 Form 3. Complaint on a Promissory Note 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant on or about June 1, 1935, executed and delivered to plaintiff a promissory note [in the following words and figures: (here set out the note verbatim)]; [a copy of which is hereto an- nexed as Exhibit A]; [whereby defendant promised to pay to plain- tiff or order on June 1, 1936 the sum of __________________________ dollars with in- terest thereon at the rate of six percent. per annum]. 3. Defendant owes to plaintiff the amount of said note and inter- est. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against defendant for the sum of __________________________ dollars, interest, and costs. Signed: __________________________ Attorney for Plaintiff. Address: __________________________ N 1. The pleader may use the material in one of the three sets of brackets. His choice will depend upon whether he desires to plead the document ver- batim, or by exhibit, or according to its legal effect. 2. Under the rules free joinder of claims is permitted. See Rules 8(e) and 18. Consequently the claims set forth in each and all of the following forms may be joined with this complaint or with each other. Ordinarily each claim should be stated in a separate division of the complaint, and the di- visions should be designated as counts successively numbered. In particu- lar the rules permit alternative and inconsistent pleading. See Form 10. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 4. Complaint on an Account 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant owes plaintiff __________________________ dollars according to the ac- count hereto annexed as Exhibit A. Wherefore (etc. as in Form 3). (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 5. Complaint for Goods Sold and Delivered 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant owes plaintiff __________________________ dollars for goods sold and delivered by plaintiff to defendant between June 1, 1936 and December 1, 1936. Wherefore (etc. as in Form 3). N This form may be used where the action is for an agreed price or for the reasonable value of the goods. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 6. Complaint for Money Lent 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant owes plaintiff lll dollars for money lent by plaintiff to defendant on June 1, 1936. Wherefore (etc. as in Form 3). (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 7 Form 7. Complaint for Money Paid by Mistake 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant owes plaintiff lll dollars for money paid by plaintiff to defendant by mistake on June 1, 1936, under the follow- ing circumstances: [here state the circumstances with particular- ity—see Rule 9(b)]. Wherefore (etc. as in Form 3). (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 8. Complaint for Money Had and Received 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant owes plaintiff lll dollars for money had and re- ceived from one G. H. on June 1, 1936, to be paid by defendant to plaintiff. Wherefore (etc. as in Form 3). (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 9. Complaint for Negligence 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. On June 1, 1936, in a public highway called Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts, defendant negligently drove a motor vehi- cle against plaintiff who was then crossing said highway. 3. As a result plaintiff was thrown down and had his leg broken and was otherwise injured, was prevented from transacting his business, suffered great pain of body and mind, and incurred ex- penses for medical attention and hospitalization in the sum of one thousand dollars. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of lll dollars and costs. N Since contributory negligence is an affirmative defense, the complaint need contain no allegation of due care of plaintiff. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 10. Complaint for Negligence Where Plaintiff Is Unable To Determine Definitely Whether the Person Responsible Is C. D. or E. F. or Whether Both Are Responsible and Where His Evi- dence May Justify a Finding of Wilfulness or of Recklessness or of Negligence A. B., Plaintiff v. Complaint C. D. and E. F., Defendants 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. On June 1, 1936, in a public highway called Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts, defendant C. D. or defendant E. F., or both defendants C. D. and E. F. wilfully or recklessly or negligently drove or caused to be driven a motor vehicle against plaintiff who was then crossing said highway. 3. As a result plaintiff was thrown down and had his leg broken and was otherwise injured, was prevented from transacting his business, suffered great pain of body and mind, and incurred ex- Form 13 penses for medical attention and hospitalization in the sum of one thousand dollars. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against C. D. or against E. F. or against both in the sum of __________________________ dollars and costs. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 11. Complaint for Conversion 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. On or about December 1, 1936, defendant converted to his own use ten bonds of the __________________________ Company (here insert brief identi- fication as by number and issue) of the value of __________________________ dollars, the property of plaintiff. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of __________________________ dollars, interest, and costs. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 12. Complaint for Specific Performance of Contract To Con- vey Land 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. On or about December 1, 1936, plaintiff and defendant entered into an agreement in writing a copy of which is hereto annexed as Exhibit A. 3. In accord with the provisions of said agreement plaintiff ten- dered to defendant the purchase price and requested a conveyance of the land, but defendant refused to accept the tender and refused to make the conveyance. 4. Plaintiff now offers to pay the purchase price. Wherefore plaintiff demands (1) that defendant be required spe- cifically to perform said agreement, (2) damages in the sum of one thousand dollars, and (3) that if specific performance is not grant- ed plaintiff have judgment against defendant in the sum of __________________________ dollars. N Here, as in Form 3, plaintiff may set forth the contract verbatim in the complaint or plead it, as indicated, by exhibit, or plead it according to its legal effect. Furthermore, plaintiff may seek legal or equitable relief or both even though this was impossible under the system in operation before these rules. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 13. Complaint on Claim for Debt and To Set Aside Fraudu- lent Conveyance Under Rule 18(b) A. B., Plaintiff v. Complaint C. D. and E. F., Defendants 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Defendant C. D. on or about lll executed and delivered to plaintiff a promissory note [in the following words and figures: (here set out the note verbatim)]; [a copy of which is hereto an- nexed as Exhibit A]; [whereby defendant C. D. promised to pay to plaintiff or order on lll the sum of five thousand dollars with interest thereon at the rate of lll percent. per annum]. Form 14 3. Defendant C. D. owes to plaintiff the amount of said note and interest. 4. Defendant C. D. on or about lll conveyed all his property, real and personal [or specify and describe] to defendant E. F. for the purpose of defrauding plaintiff and hindering and delaying the collection of the indebtedness evidenced by the note above re- ferred to. Wherefore plaintiff demands: (1) That plaintiff have judgment against defendant C. D. for lll dollars and interest; (2) that the aforesaid conveyance to de- fendant E. F. be declared void and the judgment herein be declared a lien on said property; (3) that plaintiff have judgment against the defendants for costs. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 14. Complaint for Negligence Under Federal Employer’s Li- ability Act 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. During all the times herein mentioned defendant owned and operated in interstate commerce a railroad which passed through a tunnel located at lll and known as Tunnel No. lll . 3. On or about June 1, 1936, defendant was repairing and enlarg- ing the tunnel in order to protect interstate trains and passengers and freight from injury and in order to make the tunnel more con- veniently usable for interstate commerce. 4. In the course of thus repairing and enlarging the tunnel on said day defendant employed plaintiff as one of its workmen, and negligently put plaintiff to work in a portion of the tunnel which defendant had left unprotected and unsupported. 5. By reason of defendant’s negligence in thus putting plaintiff to work in that portion of the tunnel, plaintiff was, while so work- ing pursuant to defendant’s orders, struck and crushed by a rock, which fell from the unsupported portion of the tunnel, and was (here describe plaintiff’s injuries). 6. Prior to these injuries, plaintiff was a strong, able-bodied man, capable of earning and actually earning lll dollars per day. By these injuries he has been made incapable of any gainful activity, has suffered great physical and mental pain, and has in- curred expense in the amount of lll dollars for medicine, medi- cal attendance, and hospitalization. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of lll dollars and costs. Form 15. Complaint for Damages Under Merchant Marine Act 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. [If the pleader wishes to invoke the distinctively maritime procedures referred to in Rule 9(h), add the following or its substantial equivalent: This is an admiralty or maritime claim within the meaning of Rule 9(h).] 2. During all the times herein mentioned defendant was the owner of the steamship lll and used it in the transportation of freight for hire by water in interstate and foreign commerce. 3. During the first part of (month and year) at lll plaintiff en- tered the employ of defendant as an able seaman on said steam- ship under seamen’s articles of customary form for a voyage from Form 17 lll ports to the Orient and return at a wage of lll dollars per month and found, which is equal to a wage of lll dollars per month as a shore worker. 4. On June 1, 1936, said steamship was about lll days out of the port of lll and was being navigated by the master and crew on the return voyage to lll ports. (Here describe weather condi- tions and the condition of the ship and state as in an ordinary complaint for personal injuries the negligent conduct of defendant.) 5. By reason of defendant’s negligence in thus (brief statement of defendant’s negligent conduct) and the unseaworthiness of said steamship, plaintiff was (here describe plaintiff’s injuries). 6. Prior to these injuries, plaintiff was a strong, able-bodied man, capable of earning and actually earning lll dollars per day. By these injuries he has been made incapable of any gainful activity; has suffered great physical and mental pain, and has in- curred expense in the amount of lll dollars for medicine, medi- cal attendance, and hospitalization. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against defendant in the sum of lll dollars and costs. (As amended Feb. 28, 1966, eff. July 1, 1966.) Form 16. Complaint for Infringement of Patent 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. On May 16, 1934, United States Letters Patent No. lll were duly and legally issued to plaintiff for an invention in an electric motor; and since that date plaintiff has been and still is the owner of those Letters Patent. 3. Defendant has for a long time past been and still is infringing those Letters Patent by making, selling, and using electric mo- tors embodying the patented invention, and will continue to do so unless enjoined by this court. 4. Plaintiff has placed the required statutory notice on all elec- tric motors manufactured and sold by him under said Letters Pat- ent, and has given written notice to defendant of his said infringe- ment. Wherefore plaintiff demands a preliminary and final injunction against continued infringement, an accounting for damages, and an assessment of interest and costs against defendant. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) Form 17. Complaint for Infringement of Copyright and Unfair Competition 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. Prior to March, 1936, plaintiff, who then was and ever since has been a citizen of the United States, created and wrote an original book, entitled __________________________ . 3. This book contains a large amount of material wholly original with plaintiff and is copyrightable subject matter under the laws of the United States. 4. Between March 2, 1936, and March 10, 1936, plaintiff complied in all respects with the Act of (give citation) and all other laws governing copyright, and secured the exclusive rights and privi- leges in and to the copyright of said book, and received from the Form 17 Register of Copyrights a certificate of registration, dated and identified as follows: ‘‘March 10, 1936, Class __________________________ , No. __________________________ .’’ 5. Since March 10, 1936, said book has been published by plaintiff and all copies of it made by plaintiff or under his authority or li- cense have been printed, bound, and published in strict conformity with the provisions of the Act of __________________________ and all other laws governing copyright. 6. Since March 10, 1936, plaintiff has been and still is the sole proprietor of all rights, title, and interest in and to the copyright in said book. 7. After March 10, 1936, defendant infringed said copyright by publishing and placing upon the market a book entitled __________________________ __________________________ , which was copied largely from plaintiff’s copyrighted book, entitled __________________________ . 8. A copy of plaintiff’s copyrighted book is hereto attached as ‘‘Exhibit 1’’; and a copy of defendant’s infringing book is hereto attached as ‘‘Exhibit 2.’’ 9. Plaintiff has notified defendant that defendant has infringed the copyright of plaintiff, and defendant has continued to infringe the copyright. 10. After March 10, 1936, and continuously since about __________________________ __________________________ , defendant has been publishing, selling and otherwise marketing the book entitled __________________________ , and has thereby been engaging in unfair trade practices and unfair competition against plaintiff to plaintiff’s irreparable damage. Wherefore plaintiff demands: (1) That defendant, his agents, and servants be enjoined during the pendency of this action and permanently from infringing said copyright of said plaintiff in any manner, and from publishing, selling, marketing or otherwise disposing of any copies of the book entitled __________________________ . (2) That defendant be required to pay to plaintiff such damages as plaintiff has sustained in consequence of defendant’s infringe- ment of said copyright and said unfair trade practices and unfair competition and to account for (a) all gains, profits and advantages derived by defendant by said trade practices and unfair competition and (b) all gains, profits, and advantages derived by defendant by his infringement of plaintiff’s copyright or such damages as to the court shall appear proper within the provisions of the copyright statutes, but not less than two hundred and fifty dollars. (3) That defendant be required to deliver up to be impounded during the pendency of this action all copies of said book entitled __________________________ in his possession or under his control and to deliver up for destruction all infringing copies and all plates, molds, and other matter for making such infringing copies. (4) That defendant pay to plaintiff the costs of this action and reasonable attorney’s fees to be allowed to the plaintiff by the court. (5) That plaintiff have such other and further relief as is just. (As amended Dec. 27, 1946, eff. Mar. 19, 1948.) Form 19 Form 18. Complaint for Interpleader and Declaratory Relief 1. Allegation of jurisdiction. 2. On or about June 1, 1935, plaintiff issued to G. H. a policy of life insurance whereby plaintiff promised to pay to K. L. as bene- ficiary the sum of __________________________ dollars upon the death of G. H. The policy required the payment by G. H. of a stipu- lated premium on June 1, 1936, and annually thereafter as a condi- tion precedent to its continuance in force. 3. No part of the premium due June 1, 1936, was ever paid and the policy ceased to have any force or effect on July 1, 1936. 4. Thereafter, on September 1, 1936, G. H. and K. L. died as the result of a collision between a locomotive and the automobile in which G. H. and K. L. were riding. 5. Defendant C. D. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of G. H.; defendant E. F. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of K. L.; defendant X. Y. claims to have been duly designated as beneficiary of said policy in place of K. L. 6. Each of defendants, C. D., E. F., and X. Y. is claiming that the above-mentioned policy was in full force and effect at the time of the death of G. H.; each of them is claiming to be the only person entitled to receive payment of the amount of the policy and has made demand for payment thereof. 7. By reason of these conflicting claims of the defendants, plain- tiff is in great doubt as to which defendant is entitled to be paid the amount of the policy, if it was in force at the death of G. H.

Form 19. Motion To Dismiss, Presenting Defenses of Failure To State a Claim, of Lack of Service of Process, of Improper Venue, and of Lack of Jurisdiction Under Rule 12(b) The defendant moves the court as follows: 1. To dismiss the action because the complaint fails to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted. 2. To dismiss the action or in lieu thereof to quash the return of service of summons on the grounds (a) that the defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware and was not and is not subject to service of process within the Southern District of New York, and (b) that the defendant has not been properly Form 20 served with process in this action, all of which more clearly ap- pears in the affidavits of M. N. and X. Y. hereto annexed as Ex- hibit A and Exhibit B respectively. 3. To dismiss the action on the ground that it is in the wrong district because (a) the jurisdiction of this court is invoked solely on the ground that the action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States and (b) the defendant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is not licensed to do or doing business in the Southern District of New York, all of which more clearly appears in the affidavits of K. L. and V. W. hereto annexed as Exhibits C and D, respectively. 4. To dismiss the action on the ground that the court lacks ju- risdiction because the amount actually in controversy is less than ten thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs.

Answer Presenting Defenses Under Rule 12(b) First Defense The complaint fails to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted. Second Defense If defendant is indebted to plaintiffs for the goods mentioned in the complaint, he is indebted to them jointly with G. H. G. H. is alive; is a citizen of the State of New York and a resident of this district, is subject to the jurisdiction of this court, as to both Form 21 service of process and venue; can be made a party without depriv- ing this court of jurisdiction of the present parties, and has not been made a party. Third Defense Defendant admits the allegation contained in paragraphs 1 and 4 of the complaint; alleges that he is without knowledge or infor- mation sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allega- tions contained in paragraph 2 of the complaint; and denies each and every other allegation contained in the complaint. Fourth Defense The right of action set forth in the complaint did not accrue within six years next before the commencement of this action. Counterclaim (Here set forth any claim as a counterclaim in the manner in which a claim is pleaded in a complaint. No statement of the grounds on which the court’s jurisdiction depends need be made unless the counterclaim requires independent grounds of jurisdic- tion.) Cross-Claim Against Defendant M. N. (Here set forth the claim constituting a cross-claim against de- fendant M. N. in the manner in which a claim is pleaded in a com- plaint. The statement of grounds upon which the court’s jurisdic- tion depends need not be made unless the cross-claim requires independent grounds of jurisdiction.) N The above form contains examples of certain defenses provided for in Rule 12(b). The first defense challenges the legal sufficiency of the com- plaint. It is a substitute for a general demurrer or a motion to dismiss. The second defense embodies the old plea in abatement; the decision thereon, however, may well provide under Rules 19 and 21 for the citing in of the party rather than an abatement of the action. The third defense is an answer on the merits. The fourth defense is one of the affirmative defenses provided for in Rule 8(c). The answer also includes a counterclaim and a cross-claim. Form 21. Answer to Complaint Set Forth in Form 8, With Counter- claim for Interpleader Defense Defendant admits the allegations stated in paragraph 1 of the complaint; and denies the allegations stated in paragraph 2 to the extent set forth in the counterclaim herein.

Wherefore defendant demands: (1) That the court order E. F. to be made a party defendant to respond to the complaint and to this counterclaim. (2) That the court order the plaintiff and E. F. to interplead their respective claims. (3) That the court adjudge whether the plaintiff or E. F. is enti- tled to the sum of money. (4) That the court discharge defendant from all liability in the premises except to the person it shall adjudge entitled to the sum of money. (5) That the court award to the defendant its costs and attor- ney’s fees. (As amended Jan. 21, 1963, eff. July 1, 1963.) [Form 22.
