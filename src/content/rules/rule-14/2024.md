**(a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party.**

**(1) Timing of the Summons and Complaint.** A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it for all or part of the claim against it. But the third-party plaintiff must, by motion, obtain the court’s leave if it files the third-party complaint more than 14 days after serving its original answer.

**(2) Third-Party Defendant’s Claims and Defenses.** The person served with the summons and third-party complaint—the ‘‘third-party defendant’’:

**(A)** must assert any defense against the third-party plaintiff’s claim under Rule 12;

**(B)** must assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim against another third-party defendant under Rule 13(g);

**(C)** may assert against the plaintiff any defense that the third-party plaintiff has to the plaintiff’s claim; and

**(D)** may also assert against the plaintiff any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff.

**(3) Plaintiff’s Claims Against a Third-Party Defendant.** The plaintiff may assert against the third-party defendant any claim arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff’s claim against the third-party plaintiff. The third-party defendant must then assert any defense under Rule 12 and any counterclaim under Rule 13(a), and may assert any counterclaim under Rule 13(b) or any crossclaim under Rule 13(g).

**(4) Motion to Strike, Sever, or Try Separately.** Any party may move to strike the third-party claim, to sever it, or to try it separately.

**(5) Third-Party Defendant’s Claim Against a Nonparty.** A thirdparty defendant may proceed under this rule against a nonparty who is or may be liable to the third-party defendant for all or part of any claim against it.

**(6) Third-Party Complaint In Rem.** If it is within the admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, a third-party complaint may be in rem. In that event, a reference in this rule to the ‘‘summons’’ includes the warrant of arrest, and a reference to the defendant or third-party plaintiff includes, when appropriate, a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) in the property arrested.

**(b) When a Plaintiff May Bring in a Third Party.** When a claim is asserted against a plaintiff, the plaintiff may bring in a third party if this rule would allow a defendant to do so.

**(c) Admiralty or Maritime Claim.**

**(1) Scope of Impleader.** If a plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim under Rule 9(h), the defendant or a person who asserts a right under Supplemental Rule C(6)(a)(i) may, as a third-party plaintiff, bring in a third-party defendant who may be wholly or partly liable—either to the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff—for remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences.

**(2) Defending Against a Demand for Judgment for the Plaintiff.** The third-party plaintiff may demand judgment in the plaintiff’s favor against the third-party defendant. In that event, the third-party defendant must defend under Rule 12 against the plaintiff’s claim as well as the third-party plaintiff’s claim; and the action proceeds as if the plaintiff had sued both the third-party defendant and the third-party plaintiff.
