**(a) Service: When Required.**

**(1) In General.** Unless these rules provide otherwise, each of the following papers must be served on every party:

**(A)** an order stating that service is required;

**(B)** a pleading filed after the original complaint, unless the court orders otherwise under Rule 5(c) because there are numerous defendants;

**(C)** a discovery paper required to be served on a party, unless the court orders otherwise;

**(D)** a written motion, except one that may be heard ex parte; and

**(E)** a written notice, appearance, demand, or offer of judgment, or any similar paper.

**(2) If a Party Fails to Appear.** No service is required on a party who is in default for failing to appear. But a pleading that asserts a new claim for relief against such a party must be served on that party under Rule 4.

**(3) Seizing Property.** If an action is begun by seizing property and no person is or need be named as a defendant, any service required before the filing of an appearance, answer, or claim must be made on the person who had custody or possession of the property when it was seized.

**(b) Service: How Made.**

**(1) Serving an Attorney.** If a party is represented by an attorney, service under this rule must be made on the attorney unless the court orders service on the party.

**(2) Service in General.** A paper is served under this rule by:

**(A)** handing it to the person;

**(B)** leaving it:

**(i)** at the person’s office with a clerk or other person in charge or, if no one is in charge, in a conspicuous place in the office; or

**(ii)** if the person has no office or the office is closed, at the person’s dwelling or usual place of abode with someone of suitable age and discretion who resides there;

**(C)** mailing it to the person’s last known address — in which event service is complete upon mailing;

**(D)** leaving it with the court clerk if the person has no known address;

**(E)** sending it by electronic means if the person consented in writing — in which event service is complete upon transmission, but is not effective if the serving party learns that it did not reach the person to be served; or

**(F)** delivering it by any other means that the person consented to in writing — in which event service is complete when the person making service delivers it to the agency designated to make delivery.

**(3) Using Court Facilities.** If a local rule so authorizes, a party may use the court’s transmission facilities to make service under Rule 5(b)(2)(E).

**(c) Serving Numerous Defendants.**

**(1) In General.** If an action involves an unusually large number of defendants, the court may, on motion or on its own, order that:

**(A)** defendants’ pleadings and replies to them need not be served on other defendants;

**(B)** any crossclaim, counterclaim, avoidance, or affirmative defense in those pleadings and replies to them will be treated as denied or avoided by all other parties; and

**(C)** filing any such pleading and serving it on the plaintiff constitutes notice of the pleading to all parties.

**(2) Notifying Parties.** A copy of every such order must be served on the parties as the court directs.

**(d) Filing.**

**(1) Required Filings; Certificate of Service.** Any paper after the complaint that is required to be served — together with a certificate of service — must be filed within a reasonable time after service. But disclosures under Rule 26(a)(1) or (2) and the following discovery requests and responses must not be filed until they are used in the proceeding or the court orders filing: depositions, interrogatories, requests for documents or tangible things or to permit entry onto land, and requests for admission.

**(2) How Filing Is Made — In General.** A paper is filed by delivering it:

**(A)** to the clerk; or

**(B)** to a judge who agrees to accept it for filing, and who must then note the filing date on the paper and promptly send it to the clerk.

**(3) Electronic Filing, Signing, or Verification.** A court may, by local rule, allow papers to be filed, signed, or verified by electronic means that are consistent with any technical standards established by the Judicial Conference of the United States. A local rule may require electronic filing only if reasonable exceptions are allowed. A paper filed electronically in compliance with a local rule is a written paper for purposes of these rules.

**(4) Acceptance by the Clerk.** The clerk must not refuse to file a paper solely because it is not in the form prescribed by these rules or by a local rule or practice.
