**(a) When Permitted.** The United States or its officer or agency, or a State, Territory, Commonwealth, or the District of Columbia may file an amicus-curiae brief without the consent of the parties or leave of court. Any other amicus curiae may file a brief only by leave of court or if the brief states that all parties have consented to its filing.

**(b) Motion for Leave to File.** The motion must be accompanied by the proposed brief and state:

**(1)** the movant’s interest; and

**(2)** the reason why an amicus brief is desirable and why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the case.

**(c) Contents and Form.** An amicus brief must comply with Rule 32. In addition to the requirements of Rule 32, the cover must identify the party or parties supported and indicate whether the brief supports affirmance or reversal. If an amicus curiae is a corporation, the brief must include a disclosure statement like that required of parties by Rule 26.1. An amicus brief need not comply with Rule 28, but must include the following:

**(1)** a table of contents, with page references;

**(2)** a table of authorities—cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes and other authorities—with references to the pages of the brief where they are cited;

**(3)** a concise statement of the identity of the amicus curiae, its interest in the case, and the source of its authority to file;

**(4)** an argument, which may be preceded by a summary and which need not include a statement of the applicable standard of review; and

**(5)** a certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 32(a)(7).

**(d) Length.** Except by the court’s permission, an amicus brief may be no more than one-half the maximum length authorized by these rules for a party’s principal brief. If the court grants a party permission to file a longer brief, that extension does not affect the length of an amicus brief.

**(e) Time for Filing.** An amicus curiae must file its brief, accompanied by a motion for filing when necessary, no later than 7 days after the principal brief of the party being supported is filed. An amicus curiae that does not support either party must file its brief no later than 7 days after the appellant’s or petitioner’s principal brief is filed. A court may grant leave for later filing, specifying the time within which an opposing party may answer.

**(f) Reply Brief.** Except by the court’s permission, an amicus curiae may not file a reply brief.

**(g) Oral Argument.** An amicus curiae may participate in oral argument only with the court’s permission.
