**(a) Dismissal in the District Court.** Before an appeal has been docketed by the circuit clerk, the district court may dismiss the appeal on the filing of a stipulation signed by all parties or on the appellant’s motion with notice to all parties.

**(b) Dismissal in the Court of Appeals.**

**(1) Stipulated Dismissal.** The circuit clerk must dismiss a docketed appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any court fees that are due.

**(2) Appellant’s Motion to Dismiss.** An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant’s motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the court.

**(3) Other Relief.** A court order is required for any relief under Rule 42(b)(1) or (2) beyond the dismissal of an appeal— including approving a settlement, vacating an action of the district court or an administrative agency, or remanding the case to either of them.

**(c) Court Approval.** This Rule 42 does not alter the legal requirements governing court approval of a settlement, payment, or other consideration.

**(d) Criminal Cases.** A court may, by local rule, impose requirements to confirm that a defendant has consented to the dismissal of an appeal in a criminal case.
