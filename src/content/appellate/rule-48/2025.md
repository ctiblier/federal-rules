**(1)** regulating all aspects of a hearing;

**(2)** taking all appropriate action for the efficient performance of the master’s duties under the order;

**(3)** requiring the production of evidence on all matters embraced in the reference; and

**(4)** administering oaths and examining witnesses and parties.

**(b) Compensation.** If the master is not a judge or court employee, the court must determine the master’s compensation and whether the cost is to be charged to any party.
