**(a) Entry.** A judgment is entered when it is noted on the docket. The clerk must prepare, sign, and enter the judgment:

**(1)** after receiving the court’s opinion—but if settlement of the judgment’s form is required, after final settlement; or

**(2)** if a judgment is rendered without an opinion, as the court instructs.

**(b) Notice.** On the date when judgment is entered, the clerk must serve on all parties a copy of the opinion—or the judgment, if no opinion was written—and a notice of the date when the judgment was entered.
