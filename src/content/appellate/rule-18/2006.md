**(a) Motion for a Stay.**

**(1) Initial Motion Before the Agency.** A petitioner must ordinarily move first before the agency for a stay pending review of its decision or order.

**(2) Motion in the Court of Appeals.** A motion for a stay may be made to the court of appeals or one of its judges.

**(A) The motion must:**

**(i)** show that moving first before the agency would be impracticable; or

**(ii)** state that, a motion having been made, the agency denied the motion or failed to afford the relief requested and state any reasons given by the agency for its action.

**(B) The motion must also include:**

**(i)** the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;

**(ii)** originals or copies of affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and

**(iii)** relevant parts of the record.

**(C) The moving party must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.**

**(D) The motion must be filed with the circuit clerk and normally will be considered by a panel of the court.** But in an exceptional case in which time requirements make that procedure impracticable, the motion may be made to and considered by a single judge.

**(b) Bond.** The court may condition relief on the filing of a bond or other appropriate security.
