**(A) A person making an arrest within the United States must take the defendant without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge, or before a state or local judicial officer as Rule 5(c) provides, unless a statute provides otherwise.**

**(B) A person making an arrest outside the United States must take the defendant without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge, unless a statute provides otherwise.**

**(2) Exceptions.**

**(A) An officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint charging solely a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1073 need not comply with this rule if:**

**(i)** the person arrested is transferred without unnecessary delay to the custody of appropriate state or local authorities in the district of arrest; and

**(ii)** an attorney for the government moves promptly, in the district where the warrant was issued, to dismiss the complaint.

**(B) If a defendant is arrested for violating probation or supervised release, Rule 32.1 applies.**

**(C) If a defendant is arrested for failing to appear in another district, Rule 40 applies.**

**(3) Appearance Upon a Summons.** When a defendant appears in response to a summons under Rule 4, a magistrate judge must proceed under Rule 5(d) or (e), as applicable.

**(b) Arrest Without a Warrant.** If a defendant is arrested without a warrant, a complaint meeting Rule 4(a)’s requirement of probable cause must be promptly filed in the district where the offense was allegedly committed.

**(c) Place of Initial Appearance; Transfer to Another District.**

**(1) Arrest in the District Where the Offense Was Allegedly Committed.** If the defendant is arrested in the district where the offense was allegedly committed:

**(A)** the initial appearance must be in that district; and

**(B)** if a magistrate judge is not reasonably available, the initial appearance may be before a state or local judicial officer.

**(2) Arrest in a District Other Than Where the Offense Was Allegedly Committed.** If the defendant was arrested in a district other than where the offense was allegedly committed, the initial appearance must be:

**(A)** in the district of arrest; or

**(B)** in an adjacent district if:

**(i)** the appearance can occur more promptly there; or

**(ii)** the offense was allegedly committed there and the initial appearance will occur on the day of arrest.

**(3) Procedures in a District Other Than Where the Offense Was Allegedly Committed.** If the initial appearance occurs in a district other than where the offense was allegedly committed, the following procedures apply:

**(A)** the magistrate judge must inform the defendant about the provisions of Rule 20;

**(B)** if the defendant was arrested without a warrant, the district court where the offense was allegedly committed must first issue a warrant before the magistrate judge transfers the defendant to that district;

**(C)** the magistrate judge must conduct a preliminary hearing if required by Rule 5.1;

**(D)** the magistrate judge must transfer the defendant to the district where the offense was allegedly committed if:

**(i)** the government produces the warrant, a certified copy of the warrant, or a reliable electronic form of either; and

**(ii)** the judge finds that the defendant is the same person named in the indictment, information, or warrant; and

**(E)** when a defendant is transferred and discharged, the clerk must promptly transmit the papers and any bail to the clerk in the district where the offense was allegedly committed.

**(4) Procedure for Persons Extradited to the United States.** If the defendant is surrendered to the United States in accordance with a request for the defendant’s extradition, the initial appearance must be in the district (or one of the districts) where the offense is charged.

**(d) Procedure in a Felony Case.**

**(1) Advice.** If the defendant is charged with a felony, the judge must inform the defendant of the following:

**(A)** the complaint against the defendant, and any affidavit filed with it;

**(B)** the defendant’s right to retain counsel or to request that counsel be appointed if the defendant cannot obtain counsel;

**(C)** the circumstances, if any, under which the defendant may secure pretrial release;

**(D)** any right to a preliminary hearing;

**(E)** the defendant’s right not to make a statement, and that any statement made may be used against the defendant; and

**(F)** that a defendant who is not a United States citizen may request that an attorney for the government or a federal law enforcement official notify a consular officer from the defendant’s country of nationality that the defendant has been arrested—but that even without the defendant’s request, a treaty or other international agreement may require consular notification.

**(2) Consulting with Counsel.** The judge must allow the defendant reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel.

**(3) Detention or Release.** The judge must detain or release the defendant as provided by statute or these rules.

**(4) Plea.** A defendant may be asked to plead only under Rule 10.
