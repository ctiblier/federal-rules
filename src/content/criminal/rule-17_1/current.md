On its own, or on a party’s motion, the court may hold one or more pretrial conferences to promote a fair and expeditious trial. When a conference ends, the court must prepare and file a memorandum of any matters agreed to during the conference. The government may not use any statement made during the conference by the defendant or the defendant’s attorney unless it is in writing and is signed by the defendant and the defendant’s attorney.
