**(b) Imprisonment.**

**(1) Stay Granted.** If the defendant is released pending appeal, the court must stay a sentence of imprisonment.

**(2) Stay Denied; Place of Confinement.** If the defendant is not released pending appeal, the court may recommend to the Attorney General that the defendant be confined near the place of the trial or appeal for a period reasonably necessary to permit the defendant to assist in preparing the appeal.
