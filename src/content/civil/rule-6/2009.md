**(a) Computing Time.** The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules or in any local rule, court order, or statute:

**(1) Day of the Event Excluded.** Exclude the day of the act, event, or default that begins the period.

**(2) Exclusions from Brief Periods.** Exclude intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays when the period is less than 11 days.

**(3) Last Day.** Include the last day of the period unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or — if the act to be done is filing a paper in court — a day on which weather or other conditions make the clerk’s office inaccessible. When the last day is excluded, the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, legal holiday, or day when the clerk’s office is inaccessible.

**(4) ‘‘Legal Holiday’’ Defined.** As used in these rules, ‘‘legal holiday’’ means:

**(A)** the day set aside by statute for observing New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday, Washington’s Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans’ Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day; and

**(B)** any other day declared a holiday by the President, Congress, or the state where the district court is located.

**(b) Extending Time.**

**(1) In General.** When an act may or must be done within a specified time, the court may, for good cause, extend the time:

**(A)** with or without motion or notice if the court acts, or if a request is made, before the original time or its extension expires; or

**(B)** on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.

**(2) Exceptions.** A court must not extend the time to act under Rules 50(b) and (d), 52(b), 59(b), (d), and (e), and 60(b), except as those rules allow.

**(c) Motions, Notices of Hearing, and Affidavits.**

**(1) In General.** A written motion and notice of the hearing must be served at least 5 days before the time specified for the hearing, with the following exceptions:

**(A)** when the motion may be heard ex parte;

**(B)** when these rules set a different time; or

**(C)** when a court order — which a party may, for good cause, apply for ex parte — sets a different time.

**(2) Supporting Affidavit.** Any affidavit supporting a motion must be served with the motion. Except as Rule 59(c) provides otherwise, any opposing affidavit must be served at least 1 day before the hearing, unless the court permits service at another time.

**(d) Additional Time After Certain Kinds of Service.** When a party may or must act within a specified time after service and service is made under Rule 5(b)(2)(C), (D), (E), or (F), 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under Rule 6(a).
