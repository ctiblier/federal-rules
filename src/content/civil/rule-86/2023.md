**(a) In General.** These rules and any amendments take effect at the time specified by the Supreme Court, subject to 28 U.S.C. § 2074. They govern:

**(1)** proceedings in an action commenced after their effective date; and

**(2)** proceedings after that date in an action then pending unless:

**(A)** the Supreme Court specifies otherwise; or

**(B)** the court determines that applying them in a particular action would be infeasible or work an injustice.

**(b) December 1, 2007 Amendments.** If any provision in Rules 1–5.1, 6–73, or 77–86 conflicts with another law, priority in time for the purpose of 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b) is not affected by the amendments taking effect on December 1, 2007.
