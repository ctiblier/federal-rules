**(a) Intervention of Right.** On timely motion, the court must permit anyone to intervene who:

**(1)** is given an unconditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or

**(2)** claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant’s ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.

**(b) Permissive Intervention.**

**(1) In General.** On timely motion, the court may permit anyone to intervene who:

**(A)** is given a conditional right to intervene by a federal statute; or

**(B)** has a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact.

**(2) By a Government Officer or Agency.** On timely motion, the court may permit a federal or state governmental officer or agency to intervene if a party’s claim or defense is based on:

**(A)** a statute or executive order administered by the officer or agency; or

**(B)** any regulation, order, requirement, or agreement issued or made under the statute or executive order.

**(3) Delay or Prejudice.** In exercising its discretion, the court must consider whether the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.

**(c) Notice and Pleading Required.** A motion to intervene must be served on the parties as provided in Rule 5. The motion must state the grounds for intervention and be accompanied by a pleading that sets out the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.
