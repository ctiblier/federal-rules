**(a) Automatic Stay; Exceptions for Injunctions, Receiverships , and Patent Accountings.** Except as stated in this rule, no execution may issue on a judgment, nor may proceedings be taken to enforce it, until 14 days have passed after its entry. But unless the court orders otherwise, the following are not stayed after being entered, even if an appeal is taken:

**(1)** an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction or a receivership; or

**(2)** a judgment or order that directs an accounting in an action for patent infringement.

**(b) Stay Pending the Disposition of a Motion.** On appropriate terms for the opposing party’s security, the court may stay the execution of a judgment—or any proceedings to enforce it—pending disposition of any of the following motions:

**(1)** under Rule 50, for judgment as a matter of law;

**(2)** under Rule 52(b), to amend the findings or for additional findings;

**(3)** under Rule 59, for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment; or

**(4)** under Rule 60, for relief from a judgment or order.

**(c) Injunction Pending an Appeal.** While an appeal is pending from an interlocutory order or final judgment that grants, dissolves, or denies an injunction, the court may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the opposing party’s rights. If the judgment appealed from is rendered by a statutory three-judge district court, the order must be made either:

**(1)** by that court sitting in open session; or

**(2)** by the assent of all its judges, as evidenced by their signatures.

**(d) Stay with Bond on Appeal.** If an appeal is taken, the appellant may obtain a stay by supersedeas bond, except in an action described in Rule 62(a)(1) or (2). The bond may be given upon or after filing the notice of appeal or after obtaining the order allowing the appeal. The stay takes effect when the court approves the bond.

**(e) Stay Without Bond on an Appeal by the United States, Its Officers, or Its Agencies.** The court must not require a bond, obligation, or other security from the appellant when granting a stay on an appeal by the United States, its officers, or its agencies or on an appeal directed by a department of the federal government.

**(f) Stay in Favor of a Judgment Debtor Under State Law.** If a judgment is a lien on the judgment debtor’s property under the law of the state where the court is located, the judgment debtor is entitled to the same stay of execution the state court would give.

**(g) Appellate Court ’ s Power Not Limited.** This rule does not limit the power of the appellate court or one of its judges or justices:

**(1)** to stay proceedings—or suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction—while an appeal is pending; or

**(2)** to issue an order to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment to be entered.

**(h) Stay with Multiple Claims or Parties.** A court may stay the enforcement of a final judgment entered under Rule 54(b) until it enters a later judgment or judgments, and may prescribe terms necessary to secure the benefit of the stayed judgment for the party in whose favor it was entered.
