**(a) Consolidation.** If actions before the court involve a common question of law or fact, the court may:

**(1)** join for hearing or trial any or all matters at issue in the actions;

**(2)** consolidate the actions; or

**(3)** issue any other orders to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.

**(b) Separate Trials.** For convenience, to avoid prejudice, or to expedite and economize, the court may order a separate trial of one or more separate issues, claims, crossclaims, counterclaims, or third-party claims. When ordering a separate trial, the court must preserve any federal right to a jury trial.
