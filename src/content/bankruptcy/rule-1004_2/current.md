**(a) Designating the Center of Main Interests.** A petition under Chapter 15 for recognition of a foreign proceeding must:

**(1)** designate the country where the debtor has its center of main interests; and

**(2)** identify each country in which a foreign proceeding against, by, or regarding the debtor is pending.

**(b) Challenging the Designation.** The United States trustee or a party in interest may file a motion challenging the designation. If the motion is filed by a party in interest, a copy must be sent to the United States trustee. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion must be filed at least 7 days before the date set for the hearing on the petition. The motion must be served on: • the debtor; • all persons or bodies authorized to administer the debtor's foreign proceedings; • all entities against whom provisional relief is sought under § 1519; • all parties to litigation pending in the United States in which the debtor was a party when the petition was filed; and • any other entity as the court orders. (Added Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
