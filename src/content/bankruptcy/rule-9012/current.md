**(a) Who May Administer an Oath.** These persons may administer an oath or affirmation or take an acknowledgment: • a bankruptcy judge; • a clerk; • a deputy clerk; • a United States trustee; • an officer authorized to administer oaths in a proceeding before a federal court or by state law in the state where the oath is taken; or • a United States diplomatic or consular officer in a foreign country.

**(b) Affirmation as an Alternative.** If an oath is required, a solemn affirmation suffices.
