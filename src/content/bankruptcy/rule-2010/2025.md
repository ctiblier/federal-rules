**(1)** a person who qualifies as trustee in multiple cases; or

**(2)** multiple trustees who qualify in a different case.

**(b) Proceedings on the Bond.** A party in interest may bring a proceeding in the United States’ name on a trustee’s bond for the use of the entity injured by the trustee’s breach of the condition.
