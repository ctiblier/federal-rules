**(a) The Clerk's Certification.** Whenever evidence is required to prove that a debtor is a debtor in possession or that a trustee has qualified, the clerk may so certify. The certification constitutes conclusive evidence of that fact.

**(b) Trustee's Failure to Qualify.** If a person elected or appointed as trustee does not qualify within the time prescribed by § 322(a), the clerk must so notify the court and the United States trustee.
