**(a) Objections to Claims.** An objection to the allowance of a claim shall be in writing and filed. A copy of the objection with notice of the hearing thereon shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to the claimant, the debtor or debtor in possession, and the trustee at least 30 days prior to the hearing.

**(b) Demand for Relief Requiring an Adversary Proceeding.** A party in interest shall not include a demand for relief of a kind specified in Rule 7001 in an objection to the allowance of a claim, but may include the objection in an adversary proceeding.

**(c) Limitation on Joinder of Claims Objections.** Unless otherwise ordered by the court or permitted by subdivision (d), objections to more than one claim shall not be joined in a single objection.

**(d) Omnibus Objection.** Subject to subdivision (e), objections to more than one claim may be joined in an omnibus objection if all the claims were filed by the same entity, or the objections are based solely on the grounds that the claims should be disallowed, in whole or in part, because:

**(1)** they duplicate other claims;

**(2)** they have been filed in the wrong case;

**(3)** they have been amended by subsequently filed proofs of claim;

**(4)** they were not timely filed;

**(5)** they have been satisfied or released during the case in accordance with the Code, applicable rules, or a court order;

**(6)** they were presented in a form that does not comply with applicable rules, and the objection states that the objector is unable to determine the validity of the claim because of the noncompliance;

**(7)** they are interests, rather than claims; or

**(8)** they assert priority in an amount that exceeds the maximum amount under § 507 of the Code.

**(e) Requirements for Omnibus Objection.** An omnibus objection shall:

**(1)** state in a conspicuous place that claimants receiving the objection should locate their names and claims in the objection;

**(2)** list claimants alphabetically, provide a cross-reference to claim numbers, and, if appropriate, list claimants by category of claims;

**(3)** state the grounds of the objection to each claim and provide a cross-reference to the pages in the omnibus objection pertinent to the stated grounds;

**(4)** state in the title the identity of the objector and the grounds for the objections;

**(5)** be numbered consecutively with other omnibus objections filed by the same objector; and

**(6)** contain objections to no more than 100 claims.

**(f) Finality of Objection.** The finality of any order regarding a claim objection included in an omnibus objection shall be determined as though the claim had been subject to an individual objection.
