**(a) Procedure in General.** Rule 9014 governs a proceeding to assume, reject, or assign an executory contract or unexpired lease, other than as part of a plan.

**(b) Requiring a Trustee, Debtor in Possession, or Debtor to Assume or Reject a Contract or Lease.** In a Chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 case, Rule 9014 governs a proceeding by a party to an executory contract or unexpired lease to require the trustee, debtor in possession, or debtor to determine whether to assume or reject the contract or lease.

**(c) Notice of a Motion.** Notice of a motion under (a) or (b) must be given to: • the other party to the contract or lease; • other parties in interest as the court orders; and • except in a Chapter 9 case, the United States trustee.

**(d) Staying an Order Authorizing an Assignment.** Unless the court orders otherwise, an order authorizing the trustee to assign an executory contract or unexpired lease under § 365(f) is stayed for 14 days after the order is entered.

**(e) Combining in One Motion a Request Involving Multiple Contracts or Leases.**

**(1) Requests to Assume or Assign.** The trustee must not seek authority to assume or assign multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases in one omnibus motion unless:

**(A)** they are all between the same parties or are to be assigned to the same assignee;

**(B)** the trustee seeks to assume—but not assign to more than one assignee—unexpired leases of real property; or

**(C)** the court allows the motion to be filed.

**(2) Requests to Reject.** Subject to (f), a trustee may join in one omnibus motion requests for authority to reject multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases.

**(f) Content of an Omnibus Motion.** A motion to reject—or, if permitted under (e), a motion to assume or assign—multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases that are not between the same parties must:

**(1)** state in a conspicuous place that the parties’ names and their contracts or leases are listed in the motion;

**(2)** list the parties alphabetically and identify the corresponding contract or lease;

**(3)** specify the terms, including how a default will be cured, for each requested assumption or assignment;

**(4)** specify the terms, including the assignee’s identity and the adequate assurance of future performance by each assignee, for each requested assignment;

**(5)** be numbered consecutively with other omnibus motions to reject, assume, or assign executory contracts or unexpired leases; and

**(6)** be limited to no more than 100 executory contracts or unexpired leases.

**(g) Determining the Finality of an Order Regarding an Omnibus Motion.** The finality of an order regarding any executory contract or unexpired lease included in an omnibus motion must be determined as though the contract or lease were the subject of a separate motion.
