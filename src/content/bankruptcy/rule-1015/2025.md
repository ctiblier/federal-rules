**(a) Consolidating Cases Involving the Same Debtor.** The court may consolidate two or more cases that are regarding or brought by or against the same debtor and that are pending in its district.

**(b) Jointly Administering Cases Involving Related Debtors; Exemptions of Spouses; Protective Orders to Avoid Conflicts of Interest.**

**(1) In General.** The court may order joint administration of the estates in a joint case or in two or more cases pending in the court if they are brought by or against:

**(A)** spouses;

**(B)** a partnership and one or more of its general partners;

**(C)** two or more general partners; or

**(D)** a debtor and an affiliate.

**(2) Potential Conflicts of Interest.** Before issuing a joint-administration order, the court must consider how to protect the creditors of different estates against potential conflicts of interest.

**(3) Exemptions in Cases Involving Spouses.** If spouses have filed separate petitions—with one electing exemptions under § 522(b)(2) and the other under § 522(b)(3)—and the court orders joint administration, that order must:

**(A)** set a reasonable time for the debtors to elect the same exemptions; and

**(B)** advise the debtors that if they fail to do so, they will be considered to have elected exemptions under § 522(b)(2).

**(c) Protective Orders to Avoid Unnecessary Costs and Delay.** When cases are consolidated or jointly administered, the court may issue orders to avoid unnecessary costs and delay while still protecting the parties’ rights under the Code.
