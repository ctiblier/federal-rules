**(a) Designating the Record on Appeal; Statement of the Issues .**

**(1) Appellant.**

**(A) The appellant must file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellee a designation of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented.**

**(B) The appellant must file and serve the designation and statement within 14 days after:**

**(i)** the appellant’s notice of appeal as of right becomes effective under Rule 8002; or

**(ii)** an order granting leave to appeal is entered. A designation and statement served prematurely must be treated as served on the first day on which filing is timely.

**(2) Appellee and Cross-Appellant.** Within 14 days after being served, the appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the record. An appellee who files a cross-appeal must file and serve a designation of additional items to be included in the record and a statement of the issues to be presented on the cross-appeal.

**(3) Cross-Appellee.** Within 14 days after service of the crossappellant’s designation and statement, a cross-appellee may file with the bankruptcy clerk and serve on the cross-appellant a designation of additional items to be included in the record.

**(4) Record on Appeal.** The record on appeal must include the following: • docket entries kept by the bankruptcy clerk; • items designated by the parties; • the notice of appeal; • the judgment, order, or decree being appealed; • any order granting leave to appeal; • any certification required for a direct appeal to the court of appeals; • any opinion, findings of fact, and conclusions of law relating to the issues on appeal, including transcripts of all oral rulings; • any transcript ordered under subdivision (b); • any statement required by subdivision (c); and • any additional items from the record that the court where the appeal is pending orders.

**(5) Copies for the Bankruptcy Clerk.** If paper copies are needed, a party filing a designation of items must provide a copy of any of those items that the bankruptcy clerk requests. If the party fails to do so, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare the copy at the party’s expense.

**(b) Transcript of Proceedings.**

**(1) Appellant’s Duty to Order.** Within the time period prescribed by subdivision (a)(1), the appellant must:

**(A)** order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as the appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or

**(B)** file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the appellant is not ordering a transcript.

**(2) Cross-Appellant’s Duty to Order.** Within 14 days after the appellant files a copy of the transcript order or a certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee as cross-appellant must:

**(A)** order in writing from the reporter, as defined in Rule 8010(a)(1), a transcript of such additional parts of the proceedings as the cross-appellant considers necessary for the appeal, and file a copy of the order with the bankruptcy clerk; or

**(B)** file with the bankruptcy clerk a certificate stating that the cross-appellant is not ordering a transcript.

**(3) Appellee’s or Cross-Appellee’s Right to Order.** Within 14 days after the appellant or cross-appellant files a copy of a transcript order or certificate of not ordering a transcript, the appellee or cross-appellee may order in writing from the reporter a transcript of such additional parts of the proceedings as the appellee or cross-appellee considers necessary for the appeal. A copy of the order must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk.

**(4) Payment.** At the time of ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter for paying the cost of the transcript.

**(5) Unsupported Finding or Conclusion.** If the appellant intends to argue on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence, the appellant must include in the record a transcript of all relevant testimony and copies of all relevant exhibits.

**(c) Statement of the Evidence When a Transcript is Unavailable .** If a transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant’s recollection. The statement must be filed within the time prescribed by subdivision (a)(1) and served on the appellee, who may serve objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the bankruptcy court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the bankruptcy clerk in the record on appeal.

**(d) Agreed Statement as the Record on Appeal.** Instead of the record on appeal as defined in subdivision (a), the parties may prepare, sign, and submit to the bankruptcy court a statement of the case showing how the issues presented by the appeal arose and were decided in the bankruptcy court. The statement must set forth only those facts alleged and proved or sought to be proved that are essential to the court’s resolution of the issues. If the statement is accurate, it—together with any additions that the bankruptcy court may consider necessary to a full presentation of the issues on appeal—must be approved by the bankruptcy court and must then be certified to the court where the appeal is pending as the record on appeal. The bankruptcy clerk must then transmit it to the clerk of that court within the time provided by Rule 8010. A copy of the agreed statement may be filed in place of the appendix required by Rule 8018(b) or, in the case of a direct appeal to the court of appeals, by F.R.App.P. 30.

**(e) Correcting or Modifying the Record.**

**(1) Submitting to the Bankruptcy Court.** If any difference arises about whether the record accurately discloses what occurred in the bankruptcy court, the difference must be submitted to and settled by the bankruptcy court and the record conformed accordingly. If an item has been improperly designated as part of the record on appeal, a party may move to strike that item.

**(2) Correcting in Other Ways.** If anything material to either party is omitted from or misstated in the record by error or accident, the omission or misstatement may be corrected, and a supplemental record may be certified and transmitted:

**(A)** on stipulation of the parties;

**(B)** by the bankruptcy court before or after the record has been forwarded; or

**(C)** by the court where the appeal is pending.

**(3) Remaining Questions.** All other questions as to the form and content of the record must be presented to the court where the appeal is pending.

**(f) Sealed Documents.** A document placed under seal by the bankruptcy court may be designated as part of the record on appeal. In doing so, a party must identify it without revealing confidential or secret information, but the bankruptcy clerk must not transmit it to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending as part of the record. Instead, a party must file a motion with the court where the appeal is pending to accept the document under seal. If the motion is granted, the movant must notify the bankruptcy court of the ruling, and the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the sealed document to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending.

**(g) Other Necessary Actions.** All parties to an appeal must take any other action necessary to enable the bankruptcy clerk to assemble and transmit the record. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
