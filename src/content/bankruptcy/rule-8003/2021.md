**(a) Filing the Notice of Appeal.**

**(1) In General.** An appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court to a district court or BAP under 28 U.S.C. § 158(a)(1) or (a)(2) may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the bankruptcy clerk within the time allowed by Rule 8002.

**(2) Effect of Not Taking Other Steps.** An appellant’s failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the district court or BAP to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal.

**(3) Contents.** The notice of appeal must:

**(A)** conform substantially to the appropriate Official Form;

**(B)** be accompanied by the judgment, order, or decree, or the part of it, being appealed; and

**(C)** be accompanied by the prescribed fee.

**(4) Additional Copies.** If requested to do so, the appellant must furnish the bankruptcy clerk with enough copies of the notice to enable the clerk to comply with subdivision (c).

**(b) Joint or Consolidated Appeals.**

**(1) Joint Notice of Appeal.** When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.

**(2) Consolidating Appeals.** When parties have separately filed timely notices of appeal, the district court or BAP may join or consolidate the appeals.

**(c) Serving the Notice of Appeal.**

**(1) Serving Parties and Transmitting to the United States Trustee.** The bankruptcy clerk must serve the notice of appeal on counsel of record for each party to the appeal, excluding the appellant, and transmit it to the United States trustee. If a party is proceeding pro se, the clerk must send the notice of appeal to the party’s last known address. The clerk must note, on each copy, the date when the notice of appeal was filed.

**(2) Effect of Failing to Serve or Transmit Notice.** The bankruptcy clerk’s failure to serve notice on a party or transmit notice to the United States trustee does not affect the validity of the appeal.

**(3) Noting Service on the Docket.** The clerk must note on the docket the names of the parties served and the date and method of the service.

**(d) Transmitting the Notice of Appeal to the District Court or BAP; Docketing the Appeal.**

**(1) Transmitting the Notice.** The bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice of appeal to the BAP clerk if a BAP has been established for appeals from that district and the appellant has not elected to have the district court hear the appeal. Otherwise, the bankruptcy clerk must promptly transmit the notice to the district clerk.

**(2) Docketing in the District Court or BAP.** Upon receiving the notice of appeal, the district or BAP clerk must docket the appeal under the title of the bankruptcy case and the title of any adversary proceeding, and must identify the appellant, adding the appellant’s name if necessary.
