**(6)** a concise statement of the case setting out the facts relevant to the issues submitted for review, describing the relevant procedural history, and identifying the rulings presented for review, with appropriate references to the record;

**(7)** a summary of the argument, which must contain a succinct, clear, and accurate statement of the arguments made in the body of the brief, and which must not merely repeat the argument headings;

**(8)** the argument, which must contain the appellant’s contentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies;

**(9)** a short conclusion stating the precise relief sought; and

**(10)** the certificate of compliance, if required by Rule 8015(a)(7) or (b).

**(b) Appellee ’ s Brief.** The appellee’s brief must conform to the requirements of subdivision (a)(1)–(8) and (10), except that none of the following need appear unless the appellee is dissatisfied with the appellant’s statement:

**(1)** the jurisdictional statement;

**(2)** the statement of the issues and the applicable standard of appellate review; and

**(3)** the statement of the case.

**(c) Reply Brief.** The appellant may file a brief in reply to the appellee’s brief. A reply brief must comply with the requirements of subdivision (a)(2)–(3).

**(d) Statutes, Rules, Regulations, or Similar Authority.** If the court’s determination of the issues presented requires the study of the Code or other statutes, rules, regulations, or similar authority, the relevant parts must be set out in the brief or in an addendum.

**(e) Briefs in a Case Involving Multiple Appellants or Appellees .** In a case involving more than one appellant or appellee, including consolidated cases, any number of appellants or appellees may join in a brief, and any party may adopt by reference a part of another’s brief. Parties may also join in reply briefs.

**(f) Citation of Supplemental Authorities.** If pertinent and significant authorities come to a party’s attention after the party’s brief has been filed—or after oral argument but before a decision— a party may promptly advise the district or BAP clerk by a signed submission setting forth the citations. The submission, which must be served on the other parties to the appeal, must state the reasons for the supplemental citations, referring either to the pertinent page of a brief or to a point argued orally. The body of the submission must not exceed 350 words. Any response must be made within 7 days after the party is served, unless the court orders otherwise, and must be similarly limited.
