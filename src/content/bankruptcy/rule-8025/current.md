**(a) Automatic Stay of a Judgment on Appeal.** Unless the district court or BAP orders otherwise, its judgment is stayed for 14 days after its entry.

**(b) Stay Pending an Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals.**

**(1) In General.** On a party's motion with notice to all other parties to the appeal, the district court or BAP may stay its judgment pending an appeal to the court of appeals.

**(2) Time Limit.** Except for cause, the stay must not exceed 30 days after the judgment is entered.

**(3) Stay Continued When an Appeal Is Filed.** If, before a stay expires, the party who obtained it appeals to a court of appeals, the stay continues until final disposition by the court of appeals.

**(4) Bond or Other Security.** A bond or other security may be required as a condition for granting or continuing a stay. If a trustee obtains a stay, a bond or other security may be required. But neither is required if a stay is obtained by the United States or its officer or agency, or by direction of any department of the United States government.

**(c) Automatic Stay of the Bankruptcy Court's Order, Judgment, or Decree.** If the district court or BAP enters a judgment affirming the bankruptcy court's order, judgment, or decree, a stay of the district court's or BAP's judgment automatically stays the bankruptcy court's order, judgment, or decree while the appellate stay is in effect.

**(d) Power of a Court of Appeals or Its Judges Not Limited.** This rule does not limit the power of a court of appeals or any of its judges to:

**(1)** stay a judgment pending appeal;

**(2)** stay proceedings while an appeal is pending;

**(3)** suspend, modify, restore, vacate, or grant a stay or injunction while an appeal is pending; or

**(4)** issue any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of any judgment that might be entered. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
