**(a) Notice of Withdrawal; Limitations.** A creditor may withdraw a proof of claim by filing a notice of withdrawal. But unless the court orders otherwise after notice and a hearing, a creditor may not withdraw a proof of claim if:

**(1)** an objection to it has been filed;

**(2)** a complaint has been filed against the creditor in an adversary proceeding; or

**(3)** the creditor has accepted or rejected the plan or has participated significantly in the case.

**(b) Notice of the Hearing; Order Permitting Withdrawal.** Notice of the hearing must be served on: • the trustee or debtor in possession; and • any creditors’ committee elected under § 705(a) or appointed under § 1102. The court’s order permitting a creditor to withdraw a proof of claim may contain any terms and conditions the court considers proper.

**(c) Effect of Withdrawing a Proof of Claim.** Unless the court orders otherwise, an authorized withdrawal constitutes withdrawal of any related acceptance or rejection of a plan.
