**(a) Fed.** R. Civ. P. 19 applies in an adversary proceeding. But these exceptions apply: if an entity joined as a party raises the defense that the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and the defense is sustained, the court must dismiss the party; and

**(b)** if an entity joined as a party properly and timely raises the defense of improper venue, the court must determine under 28 U.S.C. § 1412 whether to transfer to another district the entire adversary proceeding or just that part involving the joined party.
