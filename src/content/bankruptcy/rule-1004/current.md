A petitioner who files an involuntary petition against a partnership under § 303(b)(3) must promptly send a copy of the petition to—or serve a copy on—each general partner who is not a petitioner. The clerk must promptly issue a summons for service on any general partner who is not a petitioner. Rule 1010 governs the form and service of the summons.
