The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene.

**(1)** identifies each debtor not named in the caption; and

**(2)** for each debtor that is a corporation, discloses the information required by Rule 8012(a).

**(c) Time to File; Supplemental Filing.** A Rule 8012 statement must:

**(1)** be filed with the principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the district court or BAP, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing;

**(2)** be included before the table of contents in the principal brief; and

**(3)** be supplemented whenever the information required by Rule 8012 changes. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 27, 2020, eff. Dec. 1, 2020.)
