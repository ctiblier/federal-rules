**(a) Who Must File.** Any nongovernmental corporate party appearing in the district court or BAP must file a statement that identifies any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or states that there is no such corporation.

**(b) Time to File; Supplemental Filing.** A party must file the statement with its principal brief or upon filing a motion, response, petition, or answer in the district court or BAP, whichever occurs first, unless a local rule requires earlier filing. Even if the statement has already been filed, the party’s principal brief must include a statement before the table of contents. A party must supplement its statement whenever the required information changes. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
