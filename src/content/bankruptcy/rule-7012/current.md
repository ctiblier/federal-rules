**(A)** an answer to a complaint within 35 days after the summons was issued; and

**(6) Effect of a Motion.** Unless the court sets a different time, serving a motion under this rule alters these times as follows:

**(A)** if the court denies the motion or postpones disposition until trial, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after notice of the court’s action; or

**(B)** if the court grants a motion for a more definite statement, the responsive pleading must be served within 14 days after the statement is served.

**(b) Applicability of Civil Rule 12(b)–(i).** Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)–(i) applies in an adversary proceeding. A responsive pleading must state whether the party does or does not consent to the entry of final orders or judgment by the bankruptcy court.
