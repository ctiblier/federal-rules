**(a) From Presiding Over a Proceeding, Contested Matter, or Case.** A bankruptcy judge’s disqualification is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455. The judge is disqualified from presiding over a proceeding or contested matter in which a disqualifying circumstance arises—and, when appropriate, from presiding over the entire case.

**(b) From Allowing Compensation.** The bankruptcy judge is disqualified from allowing compensation to a relative or to a person who is so connected with the judge as to make the judge’s allowing it improper.
