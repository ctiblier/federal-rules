**(a) Conditions for an Emergency.** The Judicial Conference of the United States may declare a Bankruptcy Rules emergency if it determines that extraordinary circumstances relating to public health or safety, or affecting physical or electronic access to a bankruptcy court, substantially impair the court’s ability to perform its functions in compliance with these rules.

**(b) Declaring an Emergency.**

**(1) Content.** The declaration must:

**(A)** designate the bankruptcy court or courts affected;

**(B)** state any restrictions on the authority granted in (c); and

**(C)** be limited to a stated period of no more than 90 days.

**(2) Early Termination.** The Judicial Conference may terminate a declaration for one or more bankruptcy courts before the termination date.

**(3) Additional Declarations.** The Judicial Conference may issue additional declarations under this rule.

**(c) Tolling and Extending Time Limits.**

**(1) In an Entire District or Division.** When an emergency is in effect for a bankruptcy court, the chief bankruptcy judge may, for all cases and proceedings in the district or in a division:

**(A)** order the extension or tolling of a Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order that requires or allows a court, a clerk, a party in interest, or the United States trustee, by a specified deadline, to commence a proceeding, file or send a document, hold or conclude a hearing, or take any other action, despite any other Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order; or

**(B)** order that, when a Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order requires that an action be taken ‘‘promptly,’’ ‘‘forthwith,’’ ‘‘immediately,’’ or ‘‘without delay,’’ it be taken as soon as is practicable or by a date set by the court in a specific case or proceeding.

**(2) In a Specific Case or Proceeding.** When an emergency is in effect for a bankruptcy court, a presiding judge may take the action described in (1) in a specific case or proceeding.

**(3) When an Extension or Tolling Ends.** A period extended or tolled under (1) or (2) terminates on the later of:

**(A)** the last day of the time period as extended or tolled or 30 days after the emergency declaration terminates, whichever is earlier; or

**(B)** the last day of the time period originally required, imposed, or allowed by the relevant Bankruptcy Rule, local rule, or order that was extended or tolled.

**(4) Further Extensions or Shortenings.** A presiding judge may lengthen or shorten an extension or tolling in a specific case or proceeding. The judge may do so only for good cause after notice and a hearing and only on the judge’s own motion or on motion of a party in interest or the United States trustee.

**(5) Exception.** A time period imposed by statute may not be extended or tolled. (Added Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec. 1, 2023; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.) [PART X—UNITED STATES TRUSTEES] (Abrogated Apr. 30, 1991, eff. Aug. 1, 1991)
