**(a) Transferred Claims.** An entity that has transferred or acquired a claim for the purpose of commencing an involuntary case under Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 is not a qualified petitioner. A petitioner that has transferred or acquired a claim must attach to the petition and to any copy:

**(1)** all documents evidencing the transfer, whether it was unconditional, for security, or otherwise; and

**(2)** a signed statement that:

**(A)** affirms that the claim was not transferred for the purpose of commencing the case; and

**(B)** sets forth the consideration for the transfer and its terms.

**(b) Joining Other Creditors After Filing.** If an involuntary petition is filed by fewer than 3 creditors and the debtor's answer alleges the existence of 12 or more creditors as provided in § 303(b), the debtor must attach to the answer:

**(1)** the names and addresses of all creditors; and

**(2)** a brief statement of the nature and amount of each creditor's claim.

**(c) Additional Time to Join.** If there appear to be 12 or more creditors, the court must allow a reasonable time for other creditors to join the petition before holding a hearing on it.
