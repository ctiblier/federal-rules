The clerk of the district court or BAP must dismiss an appeal if the parties file a signed dismissal agreement specifying how costs are to be paid and pay any fees that are due. An appeal may be dismissed on the appellant’s motion on terms agreed to by the parties or fixed by the district court or BAP. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
