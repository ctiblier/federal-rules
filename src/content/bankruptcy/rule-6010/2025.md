This rule applies if a lien voidable under § 547 has been dissolved by furnishing a bond or other obligation, and the surety has been indemnified by the transfer of or creation of a lien on the debtor’s nonexempt property. The surety must be joined as a defendant in any proceeding to avoid that transfer or lien. Part VII governs the proceeding.
