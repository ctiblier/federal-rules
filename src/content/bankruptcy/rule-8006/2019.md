**(a) Effective Date of a Certification.** A certification of a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court for direct review in a court of appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2) is effective when:

**(1)** the certification has been filed;

**(2)** a timely appeal has been taken under Rule 8003 or 8004; and

**(3)** the notice of appeal has become effective under Rule 8002.

**(b) Filing the Certification.** The certification must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending. For purposes of this rule, a matter remains pending in the bankruptcy court for 30 days after the effective date under Rule 8002 of the first notice of appeal from the judgment, order, or decree for which direct review is sought. A matter is pending in the district court or BAP thereafter.

**(c) Joint Certification by all Appellants and Appellees.**

**(1) How Accomplished.** A joint certification by all the appellants and appellees under 28 U.S.C. § 158(d)(2)(A) must be made by using the appropriate Official Form. The parties may supplement the certification with a short statement of the basis for the certification, which may include the information listed in subdivision (f)(2).

**(2) Supplemental Statement by the Court.** Within 14 days after the parties’ certification, the bankruptcy court or the court in which the matter is then pending may file a short supplemental statement about the merits of the certification.

**(d) The Court That May Make the Certification.** Only the court where the matter is pending, as provided in subdivision (b), may certify a direct review on request of parties or on its own motion.

**(e) Certification on the Court ’ s Own Motion.**

**(1) How Accomplished.** A certification on the court’s own motion must be set forth in a separate document. The clerk of the certifying court must serve it on the parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1). The certification must be accompanied by an opinion or memorandum that contains the information required by subdivision (f)(2)(A)–(D).

**(2) Supplemental Statement by a Party.** Within 14 days after the court’s certification, a party may file with the clerk of the certifying court a short supplemental statement regarding the merits of certification.

**(f) Certification by the Court on Request.**

**(1) How Requested.** A request by a party for certification that a circumstance specified in 28 U.S.C. §158(d)(2)(A)(i)–(iii) applies—or a request by a majority of the appellants and a majority of the appellees—must be filed with the clerk of the court where the matter is pending within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree.

**(2) Service and Contents.** The request must be served on all parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1), and it must include the following:

**(E)** a copy of the judgment, order, or decree and any related opinion or memorandum.

**(3) Time to File a Response or a Cross-Request.** A party may file a response to the request within 14 days after the request is served, or such other time as the court where the matter is pending allows. A party may file a cross-request for certification within 14 days after the request is served, or within 60 days after the entry of the judgment, order, or decree, whichever occurs first.

**(4) Oral Argument Not Required.** The request, cross-request, and any response are submitted without oral argument unless the court where the matter is pending orders otherwise.

**(5) Form and Service of the Certification.** If the court certifies a direct appeal in response to the request, it must do so in a separate document. The certification must be served on the parties to the appeal in the manner required for service of a notice of appeal under Rule 8003(c)(1).

**(g) Proceeding in the Court of Appeals Following a Certifi - cation .** Within 30 days after the date the certification becomes effective under subdivision (a), a request for permission to take a direct appeal to the court of appeals must be filed with the circuit clerk in accordance with F.R.App.P. 6(c).
