**(a) Determination of Amount of Claim.** On request by a party in interest and after notice—to the holder of the claim and any other entity the court designates—and a hearing, the court may determine:

**(1)** the amount of a secured claim under § 506(a) of the Code; or

**(2)** the amount of a claim entitled to priority under § 507 of the Code.

**(b) Request for Determination; How Made.** Except as provided in subdivision (c), a request to determine the amount of a secured claim may be made by motion, in a claim objection, or in a plan filed in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 case. When the request is made in a chapter 12 or chapter 13 plan, the plan shall be served on the holder of the claim and any other entity the court designates in the manner provided for service of a summons and complaint by Rule 7004. A request to determine the amount of a claim entitled to priority may be made only by motion after a claim is filed or in a claim objection.

**(c) Claims of Governmental Units.** A request to determine the amount of a secured claim of a governmental unit may be made only by motion or in a claim objection after the governmental unit files a proof of claim or after the time for filing one under Rule 3002(c)(1) has expired.
