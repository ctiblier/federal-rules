**(a) In General.** On a party in interest's request, after notice and a hearing, the court may determine the amount of a secured claim under § 506(a) or the amount of a priority claim under § 507. The notice must be served on: • the claim holder; and • any other entity the court designates.

**(b) Determining the Amount of a Claim.**

**(1) Secured Claim.** Except as provided in (c), a request to determine the amount of a secured claim may be made by motion, in an objection to a claim, or in a plan filed in a Chapter 12 or 13 case. If the request is included in a plan, a copy of the plan must be served on the claim holder and any other entity the court designates as if it were a summons and complaint under Rule 7004.

**(2) Priority Claim.** A request to determine the amount of a priority claim may be made only by motion after the claim is filed or in an objection to the claim.

**(c) Governmental Unit's Secured Claim.** A request to determine the amount of a governmental unit's secured claim may be made only by motion—or in an objection to a claim—filed after:

**(1)** the governmental unit has filed the proof of claim; or

**(2)** the time to file it under Rule 3002(c)(1) has expired.
