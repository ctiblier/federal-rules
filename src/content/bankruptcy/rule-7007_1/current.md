**(a) Required Disclosure.** Any nongovernmental corporation— other than the debtor—that is a party to an adversary proceeding must file a statement identifying any parent corporation and any publicly held corporation that owns 10% or more of its stock or stating that there is no such corporation. The same requirement applies to a nongovernmental corporation that seeks to intervene.

**(b) Time for Filing; Supplemental Filing.** The statement must:

**(1)** be filed with the corporation's first appearance, pleading, motion, response, or other request to the court; and

**(2)** be supplemented whenever the information required by this rule changes. (Added Mar. 27, 2003, eff. Dec. 1, 2003; amended Apr. 30, 2007, eff. Dec. 1, 2007; Apr. 14, 2021, eff. Dec. 1, 2021; Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
