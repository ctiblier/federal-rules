**(a) Custodian's Report and Account.** A custodian required by the Code to deliver property to the trustee must promptly file and send to the United States trustee a report and account about the property of the estate and its administration.

**(b) Examining the Administration.** After the custodian's report and account has been filed and the superseded administration has been examined, the court must, after notice and a hearing, determine whether the custodian's administration has been proper, including whether disbursements have been reasonable.
