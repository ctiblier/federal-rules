**(a) Dismissing a Case —In General.** Except as provided in § 707(a)(3), 707(b), 1208(b), or 1307(b), or in Rule 1017(b), (c), or (e), the court must conduct a hearing on notice under Rule 2002 before dismissing a case on the petitioner's motion, for want of prosecution or other cause, or by the parties' consent. For the purpose of the notice, a debtor who has not already filed a list of creditors and their addresses must do so before the deadline set by the court. If the debtor fails to timely file the list, the court may order the debtor or another entity to do so.

**(b) Dismissing a Case for Failure to Pay an Installment Toward the Filing Fee.** If the debtor fails to pay any installment toward the filing fee, the court may dismiss the case after a hearing on notice to the debtor and trustee. If the court dismisses or closes the case without full payment of the filing fee, previous installment payments must be distributed as if full payment had been made.

**(c) Dismissing a Voluntary Chapter 7 or Chapter 13Case for Failure to File a Document on Time.** On motion of the United States trustee, the court may dismiss a voluntary Chapter 7 case under § 707(a)(3), or a Chapter 13 case under § 1307(c)(9), for a failure to timely file the information required by § 521(a)(1). But the court may do so only after a hearing on notice served by the United States trustee on the debtor, trustee, and any other entity as the court orders.

**(d)** Dismissing a Case or Suspending Proceedings Under § 305. The court may dismiss a case or suspend proceedings under § 305 only after a hearing on notice under Rule 2002(a).

**(e) Dismissing an Individual Debtor's Chapter 7 Case for Abuse or Converting It to Chapter 11 or 13.**

**(1) In General.** On motion under § 707(b), the court may dismiss an individual debtor's Chapter 7 case for abuse or, with the debtor's consent, convert it to Chapter 11 or 13. The court may do so only after a hearing on notice to: • the debtor; • the trustee; • the United States trustee; and • any other entity as the court orders.

**(2) Time to File a Motion; Content.** Except as § 704(b)(2) provides otherwise, a motion to dismiss a case for abuse under § 707(b) or (c) must be filed within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341(a). On request made within the 60-day period, the court may, for cause, extend the time to file. The motion must:

**(A)** set forth all matters to be considered at the hearing; and

**(B)** if made under § 707(b)(1) and (3), state with particularity the circumstances alleged to constitute abuse.

**(3) Hearing on the Court's Own Motion; Serving Notice.** If the hearing is set on the court's own motion, the clerk must serve notice on the debtor within 60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors under § 341(a). The notice must set forth all matters to be considered at the hearing.

**(f) Procedures for Dismissing, Suspending, or Converting a Case.**

**(1) In General.** Rule 9014 governs a proceeding to dismiss or suspend a case or to convert it to another chapter—except under § 706(a), 1112(a), 1208(a) or (b), or 1307(a) or (b).

**(2) Cases Requiring a Motion.** Dismissing or converting a case under § 706(a), 1112(a), 1208(b), or 1307(b) requires a motion filed and served as required by Rule 9013.

**(3) Conversion in a Chapter 12 or 13 Case.** If the debtor files a conversion notice under § 1208(a) or § 1307(a), the case will be converted without court order. The notice date becomes the date of the conversion order in applying § 348(c) or Rule 1019. The clerk must promptly send a copy of the notice to the United States trustee.
