**(a) Reporter ’ s Duties.**

**(1) Proceedings Recorded Without a Reporter Present.** If proceedings were recorded without a reporter being present, the person or service selected under bankruptcy court procedures to transcribe the recording is the reporter for purposes of this rule.

**(2) Preparing and Filing the Transcript.** The reporter must prepare and file a transcript as follows:

**(A)** Upon receiving an order for a transcript in accordance with Rule 8009(b), the reporter must file in the bankruptcy court an acknowledgment of the request that shows when it was received, and when the reporter expects to have the transcript completed.

**(B)** After completing the transcript, the reporter must file it with the bankruptcy clerk, who will notify the district, BAP, or circuit clerk of its filing.

**(C) If the transcript cannot be completed within 30 days after receiving the order, the reporter must request an extension of time from the bankruptcy clerk.** The clerk must enter on the docket and notify the parties whether the extension is granted.

**(D)** If the reporter does not file the transcript on time, the bankruptcy clerk must notify the bankruptcy judge.

**(b) Clerk ’ s Duties.**

**(1) Transmitting the Record—In General.** Subject to Rule 8009(f) and subdivision (b)(5) of this rule, when the record is complete, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit to the clerk of the court where the appeal is pending either the record or a notice that the record is available electronically.

**(2) Multiple Appeals.** If there are multiple appeals from a judgment, order, or decree, the bankruptcy clerk must transmit a single record.

**(3) Receiving the Record.** Upon receiving the record or notice that it is available electronically, the district, BAP, or circuit clerk must enter that information on the docket and promptly notify all parties to the appeal.

**(4) If Paper Copies Are Ordered.** If the court where the appeal is pending directs that paper copies of the record be provided, the clerk of that court must so notify the appellant. If the appellant fails to provide them, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare them at the appellant’s expense.

**(5) When Leave to Appeal is Requested.** Subject to subdivision (c), if a motion for leave to appeal has been filed under Rule 8004, the bankruptcy clerk must prepare and transmit the record only after the district court, BAP, or court of appeals grants leave.

**(c) Record for a Preliminary Motion in the District Court, BAP, or Court of Appeals.** This subdivision (c) applies if, before the record is transmitted, a party moves in the district court, BAP, or court of appeals for any of the following relief: • leave to appeal; • dismissal; • a stay pending appeal; • approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment; or • any other intermediate order. The bankruptcy clerk must then transmit to the clerk of the court where the relief is sought any parts of the record designated by a party to the appeal or a notice that those parts are available electronically.
