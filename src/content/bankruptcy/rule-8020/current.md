**(a) Frivolous Appeal; Damages and Costs.** If the district court or BAP determines that an appeal is frivolous, then after a separate motion is filed or the court gives notice and a reasonable opportunity to respond, it may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.

**(b) Other Misconduct; Sanctions.** The district court or BAP may discipline or sanction an attorney or party appearing before it for other misconduct, including a failure to comply with a court order. But the court must first give the attorney or party reasonable notice and an opportunity to show cause to the contrary—and if requested, grant a hearing. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
