Unless the court orders otherwise, if the debtor is a health care business, the trustee may transfer a patient to another health care business under § 704(a)(12) only if the trustee gives at least 14 days' notice of the transfer to: • any patient-care ombudsman; • the patient; and • any family member or other contact person whose name and address have been given to the trustee or the debtor in order to provide information about the patient's health care. The notice is subject to applicable nonbankruptcy law concerning patient privacy. (Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; amended Mar. 26, 2009, eff. Dec. 1, 2009; Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
