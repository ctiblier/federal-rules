**(a) In General.** Unless (b) or (c) applies, every petition must be accompanied by the filing fee. In this rule''filing fee'' means:

**(1)** the filing fee required by 28 U.S.C. § 1930(a)(1)–(5); and

**(2)** any other fee that the Judicial Conference of the United States requires under 28 U.S.C. § 1930(b) to be paid upon filing.

**(b) Paying by Installment.**

**(1) Application to Pay by Installment.** The clerk must accept for filing an individual's voluntary petition, regardless of whether any part of the filing fee is paid, if it is accompanied by a completed and signed application to pay in installments (Form 103A).

**(2) Court Decision on Installments.** Before the meeting of creditors, the court may order payment of the entire filing fee or may order the debtor to pay it in installments, designating the number of installments (not to exceed 4), the amount of each one, and payment dates. All payments must be made within 120 days after the petition is filed. The court may, for cause, extend the time to pay an installment, but the last one must be paid within 180 days after the petition is filed.

**(3) Postponing Other Payments.** Until the filing fee has been paid in full, the debtor or Chapter 13 trustee must not make any further payment to an attorney or any other person who provides services to the debtor in connection with the case.

**(c) Waiving the Filing Fee.** The clerk must accept for filing an individual's voluntary Chapter 7 petition if it is accompanied by a completed and signed application to waive the filing fee (Form 103B).
