**(A)** the following, as applicable: • a committee elected under § 705 or appointed under § 1102; • the committee’s authorized agent; or • the creditors included on the list filed under Rule 1007(d) if the case is a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 case and no committee of unsecured creditors has been appointed under § 1102; and

**(B)** any other entity the court designates.

**(2) Relief Without Notice.** Relief from a stay under § 362(a)—or a request under § 363(e) to prohibit or condition the use, sale, or lease of property—may be granted without prior notice only if:

**(A)** specific facts—shown by either an affidavit or a verified motion—clearly demonstrate that the movant will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage before the adverse party or its attorney can be heard in opposition; and

**(B)** the movant’s attorney certifies to the court in writing what efforts, if any, have been made to give notice and why it should not be required.

**(3) Notice of Relief; Motion for Reinstatement or Reconsideration.**

**(A) Notice of Relief.** A party who obtains relief under (2) and under § 362(f) or § 363(e) must:

**(i)** immediately give oral notice both to the debtor and to the trustee or the debtor in possession; and

**(ii)** promptly send them a copy of the order granting relief.

**(B) Motion for Reinstatement or Reconsideration.** On 2 days’ notice to the party who obtained relief under (2)—or on shorter notice as the court may order—the adverse party may move to reinstate the stay or reconsider the order prohibiting or conditioning the use, sale, or lease of property. The court must proceed expeditiously to hear and decide the motion.

**(4) Stay of an Order Granting Relief from the Automatic Stay.** Unless the court orders otherwise, an order granting a motion for relief from the automatic stay under (1) is stayed for 14 days after it is entered.

**(B) Content.** The motion must consist of—or if the motion exceeds five pages, begin with—a concise statement of the relief requested, no longer than five pages. The statement must list or summarize all material provisions (citing their locations in the relevant documents), including: • the name of each entity with an interest in the cash collateral; • how it will be used; • the material terms of its use, including duration; and • all liens, cash payments, or other adequate protection that will be provided to each entity with an interest in the cash collateral—or if no such protection is proposed, an explanation of how each entity’s interest is adequately protected.

**(2) Hearings; Notice.**

**(A) Preliminary and Final Hearings.** The court may begin a final hearing on the motion no earlier than 14 days after it has been served. If the motion so requests, the court may conduct a preliminary hearing before that 14-day period ends. After a preliminary hearing, the court may authorize using only the cash collateral necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm to the estate pending a final hearing.

**(B) Notice.** Notice of a hearing must be given to the parties who must be served with the motion under (1)(C) and to any other entity the court designates.
