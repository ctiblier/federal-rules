**(a) In General.**

**(1) Who May Accept or Reject a Plan.** Within the time set by the court under Rule 3017, 3017.1, or 3017.2, a claim holder or equity security holder may accept or reject a Chapter 9 or Chapter 11 plan under § 1126.

**(2) Claim Based on a Security of Record.** Subject to (b), an equity security holder or creditor whose claim is based on a security of record may accept or reject a plan only if the equity security holder or creditor is the holder of record:

**(A)** on the date the order approving the disclosure statement is entered; or

**(B)** on another date the court sets:

**(i)** under Rule 3017.2; or

**(ii)** after notice and a hearing and for cause.

**(3) Changing or Withdrawing an Acceptance or Rejection.** After notice and a hearing and for cause, the court may permit a creditor or equity security holder to change or withdraw an acceptance or rejection.

**(4) Temporarily Allowing a Claim or Interest.** Even if an objection to a claim or interest has been filed, the court may, after notice and a hearing, temporarily allow a claim or interest in an amount that the court considers proper for voting to accept or reject a plan.

**(b) Treatment of Acceptances or Rejections Obtained Before the Petition Was Filed.**

**(1) Acceptance or Rejection by a Nonholder of Record.** An equity security holder or creditor who accepted or rejected a plan before the petition was filed will not be considered to have accepted or rejected the plan under § 1126(b) if the equity security holder or creditor:

**(A)** has a claim or interest based on a security of record; and

**(B)** was not the security's holder of record on the date specified in the solicitation of the acceptance or rejection.

**(2) Defective Solicitations.** A holder of a claim or interest who accepted or rejected a plan before the petition was filed will not be considered to have accepted or rejected the plan if the court finds, after notice and a hearing, that:

**(A)** the plan was not sent to substantially all creditors and equity security holders of the same class;

**(B)** an unreasonably short time was prescribed for those creditors and equity security holders to accept or reject the plan; or

**(C)** the solicitation did not comply with § 1126(b).

**(c) Form for Accepting or Rejecting a Plan; Procedure When More Than One Plan Is Filed.**

**(1) Form.** An acceptance or rejection of a plan must:

**(A)** be in writing;

**(B)** identify the plan or plans;

**(C)** be signed by the creditor or equity security holder— or an authorized agent; and

**(D)** conform to Form 314.

**(2) When More Than One Plan Is Distributed.** If more than one plan is sent under Rule 3017, a creditor or equity security holder may accept or reject one or more plans and may indicate preferences among those accepted.

**(d) Partially Secured Creditor.** If a creditor's claim has been allowed in part as a secured claim and in part as an unsecured claim, the creditor may accept or reject a plan in both capacities.
