**(a) Motion to Review the Appointment.** If, in a Chapter 9 or 11 case, a committee appointed by the United States trustee under § 1102(a) consists of the members of a committee organized by creditors before the case commenced, the court may determine whether the committee's appointment satisfies the requirements of § 1102(b)(1). The court may do so on a party in interest's motion and after a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and other entities as the court orders.

**(b) Determining Whether the Committee Was Fairly Chosen.** The court may find that the committee was fairly chosen if:

**(1)** it was selected by a majority in number and amount of claims of unsecured creditors who are entitled to vote under § 702(a) and who were present or represented at a meeting where:

**(A)** all creditors with unsecured claims of over $1,000—or the 100 unsecured creditors with the largest claims—had at least 7 days' written notice; and

**(B)** written minutes reporting the voting creditors' names and the amounts of their claims are available for inspection;

**(2)** all proxies voted at the meeting were solicited under Rule 2006;

**(3)** the lists and statements required by Rule 2006(e) have been sent to the United States trustee; and

**(4)** the committee's organization was in all other respects fair and proper.

**(c) Failure to Comply with Appointment Requirements.** If, after a hearing on notice under (a), the court finds that a committee appointment fails to satisfy the requirements of § 1102(b)(1), it:

**(1)** must order the United States trustee to vacate the appointment; and

**(2)** may order other appropriate action.
