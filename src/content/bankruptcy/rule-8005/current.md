**(a) Filing a Statement of Election.** To elect to have the district court hear an appeal, a party must file a statement of election within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 158(c)(1). The statement must substantially conform to Form 417A.

**(b) Sending Documents Relating to the Appeal.** Upon receiving an appellant’s timely statement of election, the bankruptcy clerk must send all documents related to the appeal to the district clerk. A BAP clerk who receives a timely statement of election from a party other than the appellant must:

**(1)** send those documents to the district clerk; and

**(2)** notify the bankruptcy clerk that they have been sent.

**(c) Determining the Validity of an Election.** Within 14 days after the statement of election has been filed, a party seeking to determine the election’s validity must file a motion in the court where the appeal is pending.

**(d) Effect of Filing a Motion for Leave to Appeal Without Filing a Notice of Appeal.** If an appellant moves for leave to appeal under Rule 8004 but fails to file a notice of appeal with the motion, it must be treated as a notice of appeal in determining whether the statement of election has been timely filed. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
