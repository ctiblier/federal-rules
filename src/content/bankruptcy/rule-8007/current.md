**(a) Initial Motion in the Bankruptcy Court.**

**(1) In General.** Ordinarily, a party must move first in the bankruptcy court for the following relief:

**(A)** a stay of the bankruptcy court’s judgment, order, or decree pending appeal;

**(B)** the approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment;

**(C)** an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending; or

**(D)** an order suspending or continuing proceedings or granting other relief permitted by (e).

**(2) Time to File.** The motion may be filed either before or after the notice of appeal is filed.

**(b) Motion in the District Court, BAP, or Court of Appeals on Direct Appeal.**

**(1) In General.** A motion for the relief specified in (a)(1)—or to vacate or modify a bankruptcy court’s order granting such relief—may be filed in the court where the appeal is pending.

**(2) Required Showing.** The motion must:

**(A)** show that moving first in the bankruptcy court would be impracticable; or

**(B)** if a motion has already been made in the bankruptcy court, state whether the court has ruled on it, and if so, state any reasons given for the ruling.

**(3) Additional Requirements.** The motion must also include:

**(A)** the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied on;

**(B)** affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and

**(C)** relevant parts of the record.

**(4) Serving Notice.** The movant must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.

**(c) Filing a Bond or Other Security as a Condition of Relief.** The district court, BAP, or court of appeals may condition relief on filing a bond or other security with the bankruptcy court.

**(d) Bond or Other Security for a Trustee; Not for the United States.** The court may require a trustee who appeals to file a bond or other security. No bond or security is required when:

**(1)** the United States, its officer, or its agency appeals; or

**(2)** an appeal is taken by direction of any federal governmental department.

**(e) Continuing Proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court.** Despite Rule 7062—but subject to the authority of the district court, BAP, or court of appeals—while the appeal is pending, the bankruptcy court may:

**(1)** suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case, or

**(2)** issue any appropriate order to protect the rights of all parties in interest. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018; Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
