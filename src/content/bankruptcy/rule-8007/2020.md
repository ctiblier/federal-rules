**(a) Initial Motion in the Bankruptcy Court.**

**(1) In General.** Ordinarily, a party must move first in the bankruptcy court for the following relief:

**(A)** a stay of a judgment, order, or decree of the bankruptcy court pending appeal;

**(B)** the approval of a bond or other security provided to obtain a stay of judgment;

**(C)** an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction while an appeal is pending; or

**(D)** the suspension or continuation of proceedings in a case or other relief permitted by subdivision (e).

**(2) Time to File.** The motion may be made either before or after the notice of appeal is filed.

**(b) Motion in the District Court, the BAP, or the Court of Appeals on Direct Appeal.**

**(1) Request for Relief.** A motion for the relief specified in subdivision (a)(1)—or to vacate or modify a bankruptcy court’s order granting such relief—may be made in the court where the appeal is pending.

**(2) Showing or Statement Required.** The motion must:

**(A)** show that moving first in the bankruptcy court would be impracticable; or

**(B)** if a motion was made in the bankruptcy court, either state that the court has not yet ruled on the motion, or state that the court has ruled and set out any reasons given for the ruling.

**(3) Additional Content.** The motion must also include:

**(A)** the reasons for granting the relief requested and the facts relied upon;

**(B)** affidavits or other sworn statements supporting facts subject to dispute; and

**(C)** relevant parts of the record.

**(4) Serving Notice.** The movant must give reasonable notice of the motion to all parties.

**(c) Filing a Bond or Other Security.** The district court, BAP, or court of appeals may condition relief on filing a bond or other security with the bankruptcy court.

**(d) Bond or Other Security for a Trustee or the United States.** The court may require a trustee to file a bond or other security when the trustee appeals. A bond or other security is not required when an appeal is taken by the United States, its officer, or its agency or by direction of any department of the federal government.

**(e) Continuation of Proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court.** Despite Rule 7062 and subject to the authority of the district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the bankruptcy court may:

**(1)** suspend or order the continuation of other proceedings in the case; or

**(2)** issue any other appropriate orders during the pendency of an appeal to protect the rights of all parties in interest. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
