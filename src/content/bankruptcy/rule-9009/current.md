**(a) Official Forms.** The Official Forms prescribed by the Judicial Conference of the United States must be used without alteration—unless alteration is authorized by these rules, the form itself, or the national instructions for a particular form. A form may be modified to permit minor changes not affecting wording or the order of presentation, including a change that:

**(1)** expands the prescribed response area to permit a complete response;

**(2)** deletes space not needed for a response; or

**(3)** deletes items requiring detail in a question or category if the filer indicates—either by checking ‘‘no’’ or ‘‘none,’’ or by stating in words—that there is nothing to report on that item.

**(b) Director ’ s Forms.** The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts may issue additional forms.

**(c) Construing Forms.** The forms must be construed to be consistent with these rules and the Code.
