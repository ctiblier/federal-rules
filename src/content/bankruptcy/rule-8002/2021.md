**(a) In General.**

**(1) Fourteen-Day Period.** Except as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c), a notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed.

**(2) Filing Before the Entry of Judgment.** A notice of appeal filed after the bankruptcy court announces a decision or order—but before entry of the judgment, order, or decree—is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.

**(3) Multiple Appeals.** If one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within 14 days after the date when the first notice was filed, or within the time otherwise allowed by this rule, whichever period ends later.

**(4) Mistaken Filing in Another Court.** If a notice of appeal is mistakenly filed in a district court, BAP, or court of appeals, the clerk of that court must state on the notice the date on which it was received and transmit it to the bankruptcy clerk. The notice of appeal is then considered filed in the bankruptcy court on the date so stated.

**(5) Entry Defined.**

**(A) A judgment, order, or decree is entered for purposes of this Rule 8002(a):**

**(i)** when it is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a), or

**(ii)** if Rule 7058 applies and Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. requires a separate document, when the judgment, order, or decree is entered in the docket under Rule 5003(a) and when the earlier of these events occurs: • the judgment, order, or decree is set out in a separate document; or • 150 days have run from entry of the judgment, order, or decree in the docket under Rule 5003(a).

**(B) A failure to set out a judgment, order, or decree in a separate document when required by Rule 58(a) F.R.Civ.P. does not affect the validity of an appeal from that judgment, order, or decree.**

**(b) Effect of a Motion on the Time to Appeal.**

**(1) In General.** If a party files in the bankruptcy court any of the following motions and does so within the time allowed by these rules, the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion:

**(A)** to amend or make additional findings under Rule 7052, whether or not granting the motion would alter the judgment;

**(B)** to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 9023;

**(C)** for a new trial under Rule 9023; or

**(D)** for relief under Rule 9024 if the motion is filed within 14 days after the judgment is entered.

**(2) Filing an Appeal Before the Motion is Decided.** If a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a judgment, order, or decree—but before it disposes of any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—the notice becomes effective when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.

**(3) Appealing the Ruling on the Motion.** If a party intends to challenge an order disposing of any motion listed in subdivision (b)(1)—or the alteration or amendment of a judgment, order, or decree upon the motion—the party must file a notice of appeal or an amended notice of appeal. The notice or amended notice must comply with Rule 8003 or 8004 and be filed within the time prescribed by this rule, measured from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.

**(4) No Additional Fee.** No additional fee is required to file an amended notice of appeal.

**(c) Appeal by an Inmate Confined in an Institution.**

**(1) In General.** If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, an inmate confined there must use that system to receive the benefit of this Rule 8002(c)(1). If an inmate files a notice of appeal from a judgment, order, or decree of a bankruptcy court, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution’s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing and:

**(A)** it is accompanied by:

**(i)** a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746— or a notarized statement—setting out the date of deposit and stating that first-class postage is being prepaid; or

**(ii)** evidence (such as a postmark or date stamp) showing that the notice was so deposited and that postage was prepaid; or

**(B)** the appellate court exercises its discretion to permit the later filing of a declaration or notarized statement that satisfies Rule 8002(c)(1)(A)(i).

**(2) Multiple Appeals.** If an inmate files under this subdivision the first notice of appeal, the 14-day period provided in subdivision (a)(3) for another party to file a notice of appeal runs from the date when the bankruptcy clerk dockets the first notice.

**(d) Extending the Time to Appeal.**

**(1) When the Time May be Extended.** Except as provided in subdivision (d)(2), the bankruptcy court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a party’s motion that is filed:

**(A)** within the time prescribed by this rule; or

**(B)** within 21 days after that time, if the party shows excusable neglect.

**(2) When the Time May Not be Extended.** The bankruptcy court may not extend the time to file a notice of appeal if the judgment, order, or decree appealed from:

**(A)** grants relief from an automatic stay under § 362, 922, 1201, or 1301 of the Code;

**(B)** authorizes the sale or lease of property or the use of cash collateral under § 363 of the Code;

**(C)** authorizes the obtaining of credit under § 364 of the Code;

**(D)** authorizes the assumption or assignment of an executory contract or unexpired lease under § 365 of the Code;

**(E)** approves a disclosure statement under § 1125 of the Code; or

**(F)** confirms a plan under § 943, 1129, 1225, or 1325 of the Code.

**(3) Time Limits on an Extension.** No extension of time may exceed 21 days after the time prescribed by this rule, or 14 days after the order granting the motion to extend time is entered, whichever is later. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; amended Apr. 26, 2018, eff. Dec. 1, 2018.)
