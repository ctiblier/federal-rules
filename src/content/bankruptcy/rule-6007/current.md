**(a) Notice by the Trustee or Debtor in Possession.**

**(1) In General.** Unless the court orders otherwise, the trustee or debtor in possession must give notice of a proposed abandonment or disposition of property to: • all creditors; • all indenture trustees; • any committees appointed or elected under the Code; and • the United States trustee.

**(2) Objection.** A party in interest may file and serve an objection within 14 days after the notice is mailed or within the time set by the court. If a timely objection is filed, the court must set a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and other entities as the court orders.

**(b) Motion by a Party in Interest.**

**(1) Service.** A party in interest may file and serve a motion to require the trustee or debtor in possession to abandon property of the estate. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion (and any notice of it) must be served on: • the trustee or debtor in possession; • all creditors; • all indenture trustees; • any committees appointed or elected under the Code; and • the United States trustee.

**(2) Objection.** A party in interest may file and serve an objection within 14 days after service or within the time set by the court. If a timely objection is filed, the court must set a hearing on notice to the United States trustee and other entities as the court orders.
