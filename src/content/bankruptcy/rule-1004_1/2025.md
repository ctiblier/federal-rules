**(a) Represented Infant or Incompetent Person.** If an infant or an incompetent person has a representative—such as a general guardian, committee, conservator, or similar fiduciary—the representative may file a voluntary petition on behalf of the infant or incompetent person.

**(b) Unrepresented Infant or Incompetent Person.** If an infant or an incompetent person does not have a representative:

**(1)** a next friend or guardian ad litem may file the petition; and

**(2)** the court must appoint a guardian ad litem or issue any other order needed to protect the interests of the infant debtor or incompetent debtor. (Added Apr. 29, 2002, eff. Dec. 1, 2002; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
