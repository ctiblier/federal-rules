**(a) Notwithstanding Rule 9029(a)(1), a district may require that a Local Form for a plan filed in a chapter 13 case be used instead of an Official Form adopted for that purpose if the following conditions are satisfied: a single Local Form is adopted for the district after public notice and an opportunity for public comment;**

**(b)** each paragraph is numbered and labeled in boldface type with a heading stating the general subject matter of the paragraph;

**(c)** the Local Form includes an initial paragraph for the debtor to indicate that the plan does or does not:

**(1)** contain any nonstandard provision;

**(2)** limit the amount of a secured claim based on a valuation of the collateral for the claim; or

**(3)** avoid a security interest or lien;

**(d)** the Local Form contains separate paragraphs for:

**(1)** curing any default and maintaining payments on a claim secured by the debtor’s principal residence;

**(2)** paying a domestic-support obligation;

**(3)** paying a claim described in the final paragraph of § 1325(a) of the Bankruptcy Code; and

**(4)** surrendering property that secures a claim with a request that the stay under §§ 362(a) and 1301(a) be terminated as to the surrendered collateral; and

**(e)** the Local Form contains a final paragraph for:

**(1)** the placement of nonstandard provisions, as defined in Rule 3015(c), along with a statement that any nonstandard provision placed elsewhere in the plan is void; and

**(2)** certification by the debtor’s attorney or by an unrepresented debtor that the plan contains no nonstandard provision other than those set out in the final paragraph. (Added Apr. 27, 2017, eff. Dec. 1, 2017.)
