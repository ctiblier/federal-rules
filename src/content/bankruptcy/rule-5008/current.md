**(a) Notice to Creditors.** When a presumption of abuse under § 707(b) arises in a Chapter 7 case of an individual debtor with primarily consumer debts, the clerk must, within 10 days after the petition is filed, so notify the creditors in accordance with Rule 2002.

**(b) Debtor's Statement.** If the debtor does not file a statement indicating whether a presumption has arisen, the clerk must, within 10 days after the petition is filed, so notify creditors and indicate that further notice will be given if a later-filed statement shows that the presumption has arisen. If the debtor later files such a statement, the clerk must promptly notify the creditors. (Added Apr. 23, 2008, eff. Dec. 1, 2008; amended Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)
