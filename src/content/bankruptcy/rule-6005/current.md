A court order approving the employment of an appraiser or auctioneer must set the amount or rate of compensation. An officer or employee of the United States judiciary or United States Department of Justice is not eligible to act as an appraiser or auctioneer. No residence or licensing requirement disqualifies a person from being so employed.
