**(a) Filing.**

**(1) With the Clerk.** A document required or permitted to be filed in a district court or BAP must be filed with the clerk of that court.

**(2) Method and Timeliness.**

**(A) In General.** Filing may be accomplished by transmission to the clerk of the district court or BAP. Except as provided in subdivision (a)(2)(B) and (C), filing is timely only if the clerk receives the document within the time fixed for filing.

**(B) Brief or Appendix.** A brief or appendix is also timely filed if, on or before the last day for filing, it is:

**(i)** mailed to the clerk by first-class mail—or other class of mail that is at least as expeditious—postage prepaid, if the district court’s or BAP’s procedures permit or require a brief or appendix to be filed by mailing; or

**(ii)** dispatched to a third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days to the clerk, if the court’s procedures so permit or require.

**(C) Inmate Filing.** A document filed by an inmate confined in an institution is timely if deposited in the institution’s internal mailing system on or before the last day for filing. If the institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. § 1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.

**(D) Copies.** If a document is filed electronically, no paper copy is required. If a document is filed by mail or delivery to the district court or BAP, no additional copies are required. But the district court or BAP may require by local rule or by order in a particular case the filing or furnishing of a specified number of paper copies.

**(3) Clerk’s Refusal of Documents.** The court’s clerk must not refuse to accept for filing any document transmitted for that purpose solely because it is not presented in proper form as required by these rules or by any local rule or practice.

**(b) Service of All Documents Required.** Unless a rule requires service by the clerk, a party must, at or before the time of the filing of a document, serve it on the other parties to the appeal. Service on a party represented by counsel must be made on the party’s counsel.

**(c) Manner of Service.**

**(1) Methods.** Service must be made electronically, unless it is being made by or on an individual who is not represented by counsel or the court’s governing rules permit or require service by mail or other means of delivery. Service may be made by or on an unrepresented party by any of the following methods:

**(A)** personal delivery;

**(B)** mail; or

**(C)** third-party commercial carrier for delivery within 3 days.

**(2) When Service is Complete.** Service by electronic means is complete on transmission, unless the party making service receives notice that the document was not transmitted successfully. Service by mail or by commercial carrier is complete on mailing or delivery to the carrier.

**(d) Proof of Service.**

**(1) What is Required.** A document presented for filing must contain either:

**(A)** an acknowledgment of service by the person served; or

**(B)** proof of service consisting of a statement by the person who made service certifying:

**(i)** the date and manner of service;

**(ii)** the names of the persons served; and

**(iii)** the mail or electronic address, the fax number, or the address of the place of delivery, as appropriate for the manner of service, for each person served.

**(2) Delayed Proof.** The district or BAP clerk may permit documents to be filed without acknowledgment or proof of service, but must require the acknowledgment or proof to be filed promptly thereafter.

**(3) Brief or Appendix.** When a brief or appendix is filed, the proof of service must also state the date and manner by which it was filed.

**(e) Signature.** Every document filed electronically must include the electronic signature of the person filing it or, if the person is represented, the electronic signature of counsel. The electronic signature must be provided by electronic means that are consistent with any technical standards that the Judicial Conference of the United States establishes. Every document filed in paper form must be signed by the person filing the document or, if the person is represented, by counsel. (Added Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014.)
