**(1)** a proceeding that contests either an involuntary petition or a Chapter 15 petition for recognition; and

**(2)** a proceeding to vacate an order for relief.

**(b)** References to an ‘‘Adversary Proceeding.’’ Any reference to an ‘‘adversary proceeding’’ in the rules listed in (a) is a reference to the proceedings listed in (a)(1)–(2).

**(c)** ‘‘Complaint ’’ Means ‘‘Petition.’’ For the proceedings described in (a), a reference to the ‘‘complaint’’ in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure must be read as a reference to the petition.
