**(a) Judgments.** Rule 54(a)–(c) F.R.Civ.P. applies in adversary proceedings.

**(b) Costs.** The court may allow costs to the prevailing party except when a statute of the United States or these rules otherwise provides. Costs against the United States, its officers and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law. Costs may be taxed by the clerk on one day’s notice; on motion served within five days thereafter, the action of the clerk may be reviewed by the court.
