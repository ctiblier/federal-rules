**(b) During an Inquiry into the Validity of a Verdict or Indictment .**

**(1) Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence.** During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these matters.

**(2) Exceptions.** A juror may testify about whether:

**(A)** extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury’s attention;
