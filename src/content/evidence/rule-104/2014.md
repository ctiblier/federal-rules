**(a) In General.** The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. In so deciding, the court is not bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege.

**(b) Relevance That Depends on a Fact.** When the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist. The court may admit the proposed evidence on the condition that the proof be introduced later.

**(c) Conducting a Hearing So That the Jury Cannot Hear It.** The court must conduct any hearing on a preliminary question so that the jury cannot hear it if:

**(1)** the hearing involves the admissibility of a confession;

**(2)** a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests; or

**(3)** justice so requires.

**(d) Cross -Examining a Defendant in a Criminal Case.** By testifying on a preliminary question, a defendant in a criminal case does not become subject to cross-examination on other issues in the case.

**(e) Evidence Relevant to Weight and Credibility.** This rule does not limit a party’s right to introduce before the jury evidence that is relevant to the weight or credibility of other evidence.
