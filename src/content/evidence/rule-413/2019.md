**(a) Permitted Uses.** In a criminal case in which a defendant is accused of a sexual assault, the court may admit evidence that the defendant committed any other sexual assault. The evidence may be considered on any matter to which it is relevant.

**(b) Disclosure to the Defendant.** If the prosecutor intends to offer this evidence, the prosecutor must disclose it to the defendant, including witnesses’ statements or a summary of the expected testimony. The prosecutor must do so at least 15 days before trial or at a later time that the court allows for good cause.

**(c) Effect on Other Rules.** This rule does not limit the admission or consideration of evidence under any other rule.

**(d)** Definition of ‘‘Sexual Assault.’’ In this rule and Rule 415, ‘‘sexual assault’’ means a crime under federal law or under state law (as ‘‘state’’ is defined in 18 U.S.C. § 513) involving:

**(1)** any conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C. chapter 109A;

**(2)** contact, without consent, between any part of the defendant’s body—or an object—and another person’s genitals or anus;

**(3)** contact, without consent, between the defendant’s genitals or anus and any part of another person’s body;
