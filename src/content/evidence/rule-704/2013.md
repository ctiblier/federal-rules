**(a) In General —Not Automatically Objectionable.** An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate issue.

**(b) Exception.** In a criminal case, an expert witness must not state an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense. Those matters are for the trier of fact alone.
