**(a) Character Evidence.**

**(1) Prohibited Uses.** Evidence of a person's character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.

**(2) Exceptions for a Defendant or Victim in a Criminal Case.** The following exceptions apply in a criminal case:

**(A)** a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant's pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it;

**(B)** subject to the limitations in Rule 412, a defendant may offer evidence of an alleged victim's pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may:

**(i)** offer evidence to rebut it; and

**(ii)** offer evidence of the defendant's same trait; and

**(C)** in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim's trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.

**(3) Exceptions for a Witness.** Evidence of a witness's character may be admitted under Rules 607, 608, and 609.

**(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.**

**(1) Prohibited Uses.** Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.

**(2) Permitted Uses.** This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

**(3) Notice in a Criminal Case.** In a criminal case, the prosecutor must:

**(A)** provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;

**(B)** articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and

**(C)** do so in writing before trial—or in any form during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.
