**(a) Character Evidence.**

**(1) Prohibited Uses.** Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.

**(2) Exceptions for a Defendant or Victim in a Criminal Case.** The following exceptions apply in a criminal case:

**(A)** a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it;

**(B)** subject to the limitations in Rule 412, a defendant may offer evidence of an alleged victim’s pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may:

**(i)** offer evidence to rebut it; and

**(ii)** offer evidence of the defendant’s same trait; and

**(C)** in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.

**(3) Exceptions for a Witness.** Evidence of a witness’s character may be admitted under Rules 607, 608, and 609.

**(b) Crimes, Wrongs, or Other Acts.**

**(1) Prohibited Uses.** Evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.

**(2) Permitted Uses; Notice in a Criminal Case.** This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. On request by a defendant in a criminal case, the prosecutor must:

**(A)** provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial; and

**(B)** do so before trial—or during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.
