**(a)** Statement. ‘‘Statement’’ means a person’s oral assertion, written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it as an assertion.

**(b) Declarant. ‘‘Declarant’’ means the person who made the statement.**

**(c) Hearsay. ‘‘Hearsay’’ means a statement that:**

**(1)** the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and

**(2)** a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.

**(d) Statements That Are Not Hearsay.** A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay:

**(1) A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement.** The declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a prior statement, and the statement:

**(A)** is inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony and was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding or in a deposition;

**(B)** is consistent with the declarant’s testimony and is offered:

**(i)** to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper influence or motive in so testifying; or

**(ii)** to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a witness when attacked on another ground; or

**(C)** identifies a person as someone the declarant perceived earlier.

**(2) An Opposing Party’s Statement.** The statement is offered against an opposing party and:

**(A)** was made by the party in an individual or representative capacity;

**(B)** is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true;

**(C)** was made by a person whom the party authorized to make a statement on the subject;

**(D)** was made by the party’s agent or employee on a matter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed; or

**(E)** was made by the party’s coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The statement must be considered but does not by itself establish the declarant’s authority under (C); the existence or scope of the relationship under (D); or the existence of the conspiracy or participation in it under (E).
