**(a) Prohibited Uses.** In a civil or criminal case, evidence of the following is not admissible against the defendant who made the plea or participated in the plea discussions:

**(1)** a guilty plea that was later withdrawn;

**(2)** a nolo contendere plea;

**(3)** a statement made during a proceeding on either of those pleas under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 or a comparable state procedure; or

**(4)** a statement made during plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority if the discussions did not result in a guilty plea or they resulted in a later-withdrawn guilty plea.

**(b) Exceptions.** The court may admit a statement described in Rule 410(a)(3) or (4):

**(1)** in any proceeding in which another statement made during the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if in fairness the statements ought to be considered together; or

**(2)** in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement, if the defendant made the statement under oath, on the record, and with counsel present.
