**(2)** conduct or statements made in compromise negotiations regarding the claim, except when offered in a criminal case and the negotiations related to a claim by a public office or agency in the exercise of regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.

**(b) Permitted uses.** This rule does not require exclusion if the evidence is offered for purposes not prohibited by subdivision (a).
